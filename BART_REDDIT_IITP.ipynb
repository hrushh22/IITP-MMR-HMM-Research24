            "User 1 - ye0bne Original Post: Suggestions to hide the Landlord Nonsense on my ceiling? Image: a painting of a picture taped to a ceiling. OP: My landlord is on crack or something. The white tape was here when I got here. The silver tape over it I put up to try to reseal it. Landlord danced around the question when I asked wtf it is. One thing I know is I am not removing that tape to find out. They're kicking us out after this year to let a frat in so it won't be my problem anymore. Until then, what can I put on the ceiling so I don't have to look at it anymore? User 1: Looks like a water issue might have happened where the entire piece was replaced and either it started again or made an “access” panel  What is above that area? A bathroom?  You can buy access panels depending on the size User 2: that looks dangerous. keep a paper trail of anything sketchy this landlord does in case you need it one day. User 3: I would get something like this  [URL]  Or a ceiling medallion or ceiling ring and put a battery operated or corded light fixture in the middle  And then put a destination in the corner  A bean bag or a single fancy chair underneath. Or a bookshelf, desk, whatever OP: I like it. I read about the adhesive tile idea elsewhere but thought it would be expensive/not worth the effort. Putting up just one to accent the area definitely seems more reasonable, and those tiles are cheap as hell. At those prices I probably could do the whole ceiling. User 3: I'm glad you like it!  I haven't used the website, so I don't know about shipping costs or speed, but I did see ceiling tiles after I posted on home depot's website and other's too.  But because it's foam, you could use peel and stick Velcro (or hook and loop) to hang it up and won't have to use glue and can take it with you if you want. User 4: Okay this is really dumb, but what if you take a photo of another part of the ceiling and print it, and then attach it using double sided tape?  Not what I would normally suggest, but if you're only there temporarily, it might be worth trying. OP: This idea made me cackle like a hyena User 4: Believe it or not, this is actually not an original idea 😆 I forget where I saw it posted, but I saw someone print a ceiling tile to cover a yellowing one that had occurred due to a leak that their crummy landlord didn't address. I think in their case they were able to just scan a good tile, and it resulted in a pretty convincing fix.  I unsuccessfully tried to find it, but I did come across this which might be another option to consider: [URL] User 5: I personally wouldn’t have anything touching it—you don’t wanna get blamed for new or old damage trying to “repair” it or even “improve” it yourself.  Deposit woes. OP: You've got a point but trust me - I ain't getting no deposit back. Nothing would change that. These people are straight up criminals. User 5: Then printout it is :) User 6: Tell people it's modern art OP: \"It represents the housing crisis. I'll sell it to you for a month's rent.\" User 7: Wow what is that covering??   Maybe try a ceiling tapestry, white posterboard, or a ceiling corner lamp but that might be too small OP: I don't know what it is. Landlord is crazy and sketchy and I will not try to find out myself. That tape is staying there. Might pull it off when I leave so the landlords have to explain it to the frat coming in.   Tapestry: sounds pretty. Will have to think about the details and find more inspo on here. Not sure if I'd want to have it flat on the ceiling or have it in the same configuration as the corner lamp pictures I'm seeing.   White posterboard: easiest option to just \\*hide\\* the damn thing, actually a better version of what I was considering doing to maintain the seal (just tape around some cardboard on it) 2 birds with one stone. For decor I like both your other ideas better, but I could do the posterboard then something else on top.   Ceiling corner lamp: Not sure how to do it in a landlord friendly way; had to look up pictures but the ones I'm seeing do look nice. This studio is dark af, so again two birds with one stone. Hell, landlords might not even notice. There's still nails in the wall from the last tenant.   Thanks! User 8: >Wow what is that covering??   You know I was about to ask OP if he's an aircraft engineer because it definitely looks like speed tape, used to make minor repairs on planes. 😄 User 9: I’ve seen people take light weight fabric and drape across the whole ceiling. You could go simple, solid color, boho, Morrocan, African, floral, what ever style you like. You could do one drape, no drape, multiple drape , just using staples or thumb tacks. User 10: That whole square around it aswell could it have been a trapdoor or something weird User 11: Mao Zedong OP: We may be headed in that direction. Homeless encampments are springing up all over the place here as rent continues to increase. I moved into my apt. because I could afford to not have roommates here. I heard they're trying to bulldoze this neighborhood to put up more \"luxury\" student complexes. User 12: The landlord special: Add 10 layers of old lumpy paint applied with a dirty broom on top. No one will ever notice!  But for real, maybe a 3d decorative paper thing. It would be really lightweight and you can just tape it up. Like lantern, fan, flower etc. OP: No shit! Y'all haven't even seen the worst of the paint. It's literally so bad, globbed on and chipping off everywhere. Everything down to the metal wire TP holder on the bathroom window, covered in globs. One of my neighbors/housemates/whatever didn't get the paint treatment and I'm not sure why. We have the same door/window frames and hers are absolutely beautiful. I'm jelly and I want to wring the neck of whoever did this damn paint  Paper idea is kind of neat too. More artsy and maybe more effort than the time I have, but paper lanterns are a vibe. User 5: Put a square shaped corner cabinet with a board near the top or a fluffy fake plant or basket something that blocks the view.    And ask him WTF it is.  Leak, drug stash, tell tale heart? User 13: Is that allowed? Like if you complain about damage does the landlord not have to permanently actually fix it but can make you put up with it as long as it functions ok enough? OP: Under my state's law the appliances need to be running and if AC is advertised, it needs to run below 80. This is neither an appliance nor an AC unit. I can only assume the painted-over tape came from someone else complaining about the hole.   The maintenance guy here is crazy. He doesn't speak English (no hate but it means I can't just go through him, I have to talk to my batshit crazy landlord) and I don't think he's actually any form of qualified.   When a shade thing broke in the yard he mounted it to a power pole. Crazy illegal and dangerous. They mounted it to the house instead one day, I assume because the city chewed them out.   Landlord said they'd paint the garage doors but just replaced them with some rusty metal plates they got from god knows where and bolted  together some \"doors\". They don't have knobs and only open with locks that we can't get the keys to. So they're just open 24/7. When the wind blows them closed the noise is unbelievable.  Enough to make you jump every time. I put rocks in front of them so that doesn't happen. Sometimes junkies wander in and we have to shoo them away before they take anything. My neighbor's laptop was stolen out of her car one day by a dude who said he left his bike here (??).   The screens on my window are held in a frame that's just held on the windowsill by tabs. The frames don't actually fit the window so they bent them to fit, creating a large gap and defeating the purpose of the window.   In my INSANELY TINY closet, one wall feels like it's made of expanding foam or something. It sluffs off if you rub it.   I don't ask for maintenance anymore. User 13: Damn no wonder everyone’s trying to become a landlord and get into real estate they don’t have to invest much into the homes User 14: Tapestry User 15: Is there a hole? How is that legal OP: Well, I don't really know if it's legal or not. But I need housing. I don't know what's under the tape and I'm not going to try to find out. User 15: Oh gotcha. Hope you get it documented User 16: If I were you, I would probably get some paintable, sandable spackle, and just spackle over the whole thing, tape and all, then sand and  paint it to match the ceiling. I like the DryDex stuff that is pink but dries a neutral color.   Embracing home improvement projects as a woman is super rewarding and if you ever get down on yourself and want to feel beautiful, try being a woman in a hardware store. Guys will fall all over themselves to help you and give you advice. User 17: With a mold lawsuit! OP: No clue if there's mold up there but there's definitely mold in the bathroom. I have a window not a vent so it's kind of inevitable. Took two months for the paint above the shower to start peeling back. Some others in my life have mentioned mold fuckery (I'm pretty sure the AC has mold in it too, they sent an AC guy and he sprayed cleaner in it).   The sad reality is that any housing in my budget is just going to have mold. I can't afford to pass up a house based on that alone. Plus my parents' house had mold, so it's not that new to me. That's just middle class America.   My last apartment had a mushroom growing out of one corner (on the top floor!) when I moved in. We picked it but it kept growing back until maintenance there sprayed it with IDK sauce. They only had one maintenance guy in a massive complex, but at least he knew what he was doing. User 17: Ah do you’re in Florida too lol. I had mold in a condo. Never got so much as a cold but was hospitalized twice with pneumonia my first six months there. I spent thousands trying to treat it and it ended up flooding during a hurricane, after which literally everything I owned was ruined. I often wonder if it hadn’t been so compromised to begin with if it would have been irrecoverable. If your landlord tries to ignore it, document everything and try to get out. You have no idea how insane mold toxicity can get. It’s more than just an eyesore!\n",
            "User 2 - fcjviu Original Post: I have this really ugly desk that I got for free through student housing. I'm not allowed to paint/ change it permanently because I don't own it. Any advice on how to make it less ugly? The colour really bothers me! Ps. I know the layout isn't nice, but I have limited space and money lol Image: a room with wooden floors and shelves with small objects on them. User 1: Moving the desk in the middle of your shelving would give you some more room and create a little more visual interest for your space.  For a temporary solution, you could always grab some peel and stick wallpaper or contact paper to change the desktop color. OP: Does peel and stick wallpaper not leave behind residue? (I don't know, I've never used it) Also my fear is it might start to rip pretty quickly if I'm writing on it a lot etc. User 1: I just used it for a wall this past weekend and it’s just a big sticker so i think you could use GooGone for any leftover residue.  Contact paper may be a good alternative with a desk pad over it to protect it from wear and tear. User 2: Throw a table cloth over it, and get a piece of glass for writing on. Did this for years with furniture I wasn't allowed to alter OP: oh ok i like this idea a lot! User 2: And check thrift stores for random largeish glass and the habitat for humanity restore if you have one! A frameless mirror works great too User 3: Get a cute indoor plant OP: It's also really messy but like, it is what it is User 4: Table cloth or runner. User 5: You won’t see much of it once it gets covers with books, lamp etc!! Search a local thrift store for a blotter or anything else that is flat and durable. User 6: Get a piece of plexiglass cut the same size and then you can put anything you want under the plexiglass: fun fabric, scrapbook paper, photos, etc. User 7: Contact paper over the top! They make some that’s easily removable!  Where did you get those baskets??? They are amazing! OP: ok thank you! and i got them and the shelving from ikea years ago, and i love them very much. here's the link:   [URL] User 8: You could get fun washi tape and cover the outer edges of it with a patterned or solid tape OP: oh that's a really good idea! i love this subreddit so much User 9: I put cute thrifted fabric over ugly furniture/walls etc all the time.\n",
            "User 3 - g0fdsx Original Post: Would sell my soul if that meant I could give my kitchen some personality Image: a long kitchen has a refrigerator and stove with a refrigerator and a sink. User 1: It is long and narrow, embrace that. Is there any way to turn that door into a focal point?  Add a valance to it, and something to the wall next to it – a series of small pictures, a household bulletin board, a piece of art. (Just stay away from one big picture.)  A splash of bold color in minor details might also be good. I’m a huge fan of using red as an accent in an otherwise neutral tone room, but that’s just my taste.  Dish towels, small decorative accents on the countertop, that kind of thing.  Finally, try to keep that countertop neat. Not entirely bare, but also not cluttered. It is the only flat surface in the room, so whatever you do to that surface will defined the room. OP: Thank you for this! I wanted to go to goodwill today to buy some cheap picture frames and make some art to go in them. I was considering blue as an accent color since it's a complimentary color to orange and the cabinets seem to be very orange lol  Keeping the countertop neat is doable but a struggle I'd you know what I mean lol. Usually everything's put away except for the dish rack. I just snapped a picture while cleaning. I was considering purchasing a hanging dish rack just to really keep the countertops clear. How do you feel about that idea? User 1: the dish drainer actually isn't a deal breaker - although it would be good to get one in that accent color.  one of the tricks to dealing with clutter is to make it intentional and purposeful.  think about it:  * books laying around are a mess, books on a shelf are neutral, and books on a shelf and artfully arranged by size or color look great. * shoes all over the floor are a mess, shoes stowed in your closet are neutral, shoes lined up by size in a mudroom or entryway look great. * kitchen towels balled up on surfaces or hanging crookedly from knobs and rods are a mess, kitchen towels tucked away until needed are neutral, kitchen towels \\*neatly folded\\* and laid flat beside the sink or hung from the stove handle look great.  It's all about making the things you need handy anyway (that's why they get left out) look like they are *mise en place* for your busy but orderly life.  with that in mind:  * turn your drainer sideways, so that plates and bowls are \"facing\" the sink.  someone walking into the room will see dishes desplayed, not the edges of random items * when leaving dishes out to dry, arrange them by size with the smaller items closest to the sink.  you didn't just leave them there haphazardly; you *put* them there because that is where they ought to be. * leave a dishtowel (or rag) folded *neatly* over the end closest to the sink or - if you have enought room - in the space between the drainer and the edge of the counter.   you left it there not because you are messy, but because it belongs there and you are the kind of person that has what they need readily at hand.  good luck OP: Whoa this is amazing advice! Thank you so much!!!! I'm going to go find a drainer that's a bit newer and will match the kitchen. Thank you thank you!!! User 2: If you bought some different cabinet doors you could [paint them]([URL] leaving the original to be out back when you move, and use the color as a accent color around the kitchen for a rug, art, etc OP: Oh this is interesting! I'm going to look into this a bit more User 3: I'm not sure how much you use your kitchen, but I have seen some blogs where they use contact paper on their countertops. Like [this]([URL]  I would also consider some temporary wallpaper for the back wall with the door. That would really draw the eye there and add a lot of interest! OP: I use my kitchen a looot. Heat, water, knifes. You name it. I'm afraid of putting contact paper on the countertops for that very reason actually. Im not sure how durable it would be User 3: Ah, okay then. I would't recommend it. I don't think it would last very long. In that case, focus on the far wall with the door and add a colorful runner. OP: Gotcha! OP: Anything I could do? This is a rental so Reno options are limited. I'm down for diy too! As long as the project is under 200 USD. I'd love to find a way to add more color to the room If possible. User 4: Wallpaper it!! Stick and peel wallpaper is huge now a days and from what I've read, very easy to apply and take off if you mess up!  You can either do a solid color or accent walls or any type of wallpaper that is your style! OP: I was actually looking at some on target! I'm not sure what color to go with. The floor throws me off so much lol User 4: Maybe choose a fun floor runner and then pick a color to accent the rug 😊 User 5: I’m not sure where you are but if you have an ikea check the discount section and see if you can get some cheap doors! Or failing that put a nice coat of white on the panels and some nice new handles! I OP: I'm in Arkansas lol...so no ikea for me! But I'm not able to replace my door anyway :( User 6: What are the options limited to via your rental agreement? OP: We can paint the walls as long as we repaint them before we leave! As far as the cabinets and countertops go we arent allowed to remove them or paint them. If we add things such as knobs they have to be removable User 6: It depends on your style as to how you decorate the kitchen. I'm afraid a modern aesthetic would be much more difficult to pull off with the current cabinetry. However, not impossible.  If you enjoy eclectic or bohemian style, I would paint the walls in a rich color, and add a vintage runner, maybe paint the door as well and It could function like an art piece. I think alot can be added just in the decorations of a kitchen! You can get wall decals in a large variety of styles!   There are lots of different styles, my suggestion would be to replace things like your fruit bowl or your  utensil jug, and if you have any plants maybe re pot them in pots that better express your tastes. Then, if you're still unhappy, consider painting the walls to match one or more of those objects, and look into adding a rug ( I know there are mixed feelings about rugs in the kitchen, if you have children or a messy dog or find yourself spilling liquids alot it's a big hassle. But if it's just you, I find they are actually wonderful if you've got a lot of cooking to do and they vacuum up quite easily)  Edit:misspellings User 7: Add a rug or two. OP: Definitely. Any suggestions on the color of the rug??\n",
            "User 4 - rjhqmd Original Post: Very hyped about my new living room/studio room! Any idea on how to ramp up on cosiness? Image: a bedroom with a couch, table and various potted plants. User 1: I love all the green! I think this is a nice reading chair away from me moving in. OP: Ohhh so that’s what’s missing! Maybe terracotta tone? Thanks a lot and you’re very much welcome hope you like coffee User 1: I'll bring my French press, it'll be mental User 2: Personally for me I think it needs height on the wall in front of the sofa. I feel like my eye is sinking almost to the floor from these great, tall plants and mirrors on the right. It’s very pretty but I think the bareness is what’s making it a bit less cozy on that side with the blank-ish wall. The lamp is tall-ish but also very skinny and it’s not a place for your eye to rest so it’s not giving the area the oomph something more solid might. Maybe a big mirror or hang the picture higher? Overall very nice space. OP: That’s a very good point! I’ve been a bit struggling with the high dark ceiling and how to make it work. There’s already a high triptyque mirror against the wall next to the table on the right, so yes you’re right a couple frames higher up the wall would help tie the room with the ceiling and help make it more coherent! Thanks a lot for the sound advice User 2: Glad you found it helpful, again, it’s a very pretty space even if you left it as is and you should totally be proud OP: Thank you! User 3: I feel it needs a really huge piece of art on the left hand wall. Something spectacular! OP: Yesss love the idea of going bold I have already started the search! Thank you :) User 4: I would hang some type of warm tone curtains and place the rod close to the ceiling to draw your eye up. OP: Yes you’re right it would help a lot with the coziness! There’s actually already a rod up there where you mentioned, but I’ve no idea how to make it work with the fact that the wall is on an angle. Probably need to track down the previous renters and ask what kind of witchcraft they used User 5: Can that ceiling light be moved closer to the center of the living room and lowered? It is beautiful, but gets a bit lost up there in the beams. Stunning space! Nice layout  Edited for grammar OP: Thanks a lot! But no it cannot ._. User 6: I would rotate the rug so it goes under the couch and towards the little table. I think it looks a bit cramped and unbalanced with one side of the floor very ‘ruggy’ and the other side very blank. OP: Part of it is because of the wide angle I think, in real life it doesn’t look that unbalanced. But that’s aah interesting idea I haven’t try to play with rug placements to see what looks best. Already wishing the down stairs neighbors a nice time while I test that out haha User 7: This is perfect!! I wouldn’t do much else tbh...aside from maybe sheer or light colored curtains at the window OP: Thank you!! Haha I wish I could but like the wall is on an angle and I’ve no idea how to put up curtains on that kind of wall damn it would give a lot to stop waking up to blinding bright light on my face in the morning… or noon..2pm User 8: I've seen some curtains where they attach the rods on top like usual, and then they add discreet hooks at the bottom where the curtains can be hooked into! Could be a DIY project if you have time, you'd just need to stitch little cloth loops onto the edges of your curtains and drill in or stick small hooks onto the edge of your window sill. OP: Thank you for the tip, that should be doable! User 9: Command strips (heavy duty) or even the large hair clips onto a rod would definitely allow you to have curtains up. Darkness is super important for sleep I think 😉 OP: Haha I had accepted my fate of bright light but yes I’ll do something about it :) thank you! User 10: I feel like the big plant next to the couch could be moved, it would open up the space and make it more inviting. Right now it feels a little in the way - but that’s also just my opinion based of one photo! :) it’s a very nice room. You could also scoot the rug a little bit into the room, just so it leaves a few cm gap in front of the console table. Same idea: inviting and cozy! ♡ OP: Yes that plant needs to be moved slightly but there’s something nice about it being in the room because of the depth it gives with the two other palm trees. I couldn’t capture this feeling with photos unfortunately, on the photo here you’re correct that the plant seems a bit like clutter :) thank you!! User 11: Only one pic? Looks like a cool spot OP: Thanks! There’s been a lot of great tips here I’ll post a follow up on tips with more photos :) User 12: String lights along the beams? OP: That could be fun! User 13: So beautiful! I love this space. I would get another rug for under the bed/side table and some wall art. Otherwise, it’s already really cozy User 14: What a great vibe! What about a large piece of art opposite the couch? User 15: I think it would be cool to switch the living and sleeping areas! That way the bed isn’t in a corner, and your couch isn’t in the center of the room. User 16: Looks great but the middle of the room looks odd. I think its the couch and the plant side by side. Keep plants to the perimeter. Also if you moved that chair/couch to the left of the rug and then got a comfy sofa for where the chair currently is, I think that would bring warmth. The current chair doesn't look comfy and it's small compared to the rug so it makes the space seem cold. Just my opinion, other than that looks fantastic! OP: You have a good eye! I agree with your point on the sofa, the little sofa is a bit of a place holder until I can invest in a nice comfy one :) thank you! User 17: StoneFX feature wall . Stonecoat it User 18: Id add two floating shelves opposite the couch to add more plants and photos/art. Then for me its missing a throw blanket and some kind of lounge chair User 19: wondering if a nice standing screen between the bed and the living space would help to make the separation between both spaces look more deliberate?   it might block some of the light from the window but if you get a silk screened / translucent / lattice type screen it wouldn't User 20: There's some great suggestions here already! I think that you could tie together the ceiling with your eclectic design with some paint, if you're allowed to paint the walls. If you can, you could try to color match the dark bluish color of the ceiling and paint both the window frame and a big, floor-to-ceiling stripe 2-3 feet wide right where your painting on the left is, as a statement wall.  If not, you could add wall decorations and shelving that color instead. If you can find curtains of the same color, you could hang them from the curtain rod you have. An easy way to keep them close to the wall would be to install a coat hook, sideways, on either side and tie them there, if you like the gathered look.  For a cute and easy touch, painting your plants' pots a main color would be great! Dark blue to bring the ceiling color to the floor, and then gold rims would be my choice, given the gold accents you have. /u/leannesaidso has some fantastic points that would go well with these ideas. User 21: Personally I wouldn’t change too much — it looks almost perfect to me (but I am not a fan of clutter). The furniture feels like it has adequate room to move around without bumping into things.  Only thing I’d add is a cozy armchair to the left of the couch (facing the window) plus maybe a little basket with a blanket or two beside it. Add some candles and maybe a nice textured throw on the bed and I think you’re set!  What a beautiful studio, you are so lucky!! It seems really bright and airy with a nice vintage touch. Lovely. User 22: Perfection! OP: That’s so sweet, thank you! User 23: Yes, should've added a fireplace and some natural rock wall OP: Damn I would kill for a fireplace ._. please call the landlord User 23: Lol , have a good time in it\n",

User 3: Find an area rug with some reddish and brown to match everything else in the room. An oriental rug would look great in there. User 4: What’s your plant stand? OP: The green one with the snake plant or the wider wooden one in the window? User 4: The wooden one in the window! OP: Ah! I think it's an older version of [this one from Target]([URL]  Unfortunately mine is a little unstable, and the new one seems a bit expensive for what it is.   I'm toying with the idea of taking measurements and building a new one by hand. User 4: Thanks!! I’ll definitely keep in mind looking for one secondhand or DIYing then :) User 5: What's that TV Stand? OP: [Here's the TV stand. ]([URL]  I love it, but the legs have stiff plastic bottoms which don't take felt tips well, and my floors are crazy soft, hence the janky cardboard sleds. User 1: The question is...what are the sleds underneath the feet of the TV stand? User 6: Maybe white? Or an off white. To compliment the colour you already have in there and to give a nice touch of difference User 7: Ok you have my dream room. I’m really jealous lol. Maybe you could add a red or navy rug. Also maybe a forest green rug.\n",
            "User 9 - kavgv0 Original Post: Make my bedroom cuter/cozier. We are stuck with this ginormous furniture (I hate it) and rearranging is basically impossible with our King bed, windows, and two doors. What would YOU do?! Image: a bed and dressers in a large bedroom with a fan. User 1: If you’re truly stuck with this heavy furniture, paint the walls beige and go like Moroccan riad with it. (I’m assuming your bed matches these dressers and has a tall headboard that would block the window if moved against that wall? If so, don’t block the window.) A tall palm plant in a basket-type planter, crisp white duvet with salmon or sage green sheets. Lots of canvas throw pillows. Throw your curtains out and get some plant/leaf ones with a white background and rich green leaves OR get all white bedding and gold or mustard yellow curtains...or emerald green! Get a bed skirt to cover your storage and declutter everything on your dressers and try to get them like 5in further apart. Put a cascading plant like a pothos on the tall one and out a gold or bamboo/rattan tray with some candles on your short one. If you have matching bedside tables, declutter them too. Get 2 matching gold with white shades lamps.  Biggest changes are gonna be reasonable money-wise too: paint, curtains, plants, bed skirt  Edit: Yes!! All awesome additional suggestions in the comments under me if you have extra funds, like: rattan fan blades, changing out the drawer pulls. I would also hang your photos above the bed in a collage wall (someone mentioned you can see you don’t have a headboard in the mirror) and switch the frames up if you can find like old dark vintage wood frames and gold. I don’t see the need for a rug to be honest, but maybe a black circle one or oval? User 2: I would do this, and swap the drawer pulls and knobs for something that matched the Moroccan theme. User 3: Totally agree. OP - your furniture is BEAUTIFUL. Paint those walls, get some plants, declutter the top of the furniture and get lighter curtains. Quick doodle: [URL] User 4: No headboard on the bed. Check out the reflection in the mirror. User 5: Also can replace the fan blades with brown rattan woven blades like Casablanca. OP: Omg you are a genius. Can you just come and do all that for me? Thanks. ;)  There is actually no headboard! So yeah, I like the collage idea. THANK YOU. User 6: I guess I'm old fashioned but I looooove these gorgeous pieces. I'm sick of white cardboard ikea crap and miss the handmade sturdy look. I'm jealous!! User 7: This all sounds good. I would contribute—paint the walls and ceiling all one color. Replace the ceiling fan (unless you love it of course) with a flush Mount chandelier, replace the curtains with light colored ones that make it feel cozy, and a bedside floor lamp. Definitely change the drawer pulls on the furniture. User 8: Deiling fans are so useful! And, it would be easy to get one that goes with the theme. I know they aren't design-y, but they are wildly practical. User 6: You need a bed skirt. User 9: So you’re saying that you can’t split up the two bureaus? Because if you could, I would consider moving the large armoire to where the bed is now and moving the bed in front of the window.  Edit: and then centering the smaller bureau and mirror. OP: Yeah, basically the only way they fit in the room is close together like that. It's been a year and I'm dealing with it but I also hate it so much lol. I'm just looking for easy ways to cozy the place up... Somehow taking the focus off the giant furniture. I dunno. User 9: Ok, well in that case, I would de-clutter the two bureaus. Consider making some of the pictures wall hangings.   Also, get a cozy comforter that goes with your curtains. Or, if you’re not keen on the dark curtains, buy lighter colored ones and match the comforter with them. User 10: I actually don't mind the furniture! If it was me I would change the curtains to white, add an interesting rug under the bed that pulls together the warm and the cool tones of the room,  switch the bedding to a white duvet/comforter with accent pillows that match the rug, and move the pictures that you have on the furniture to the wall. From there I would add a few plants to go on the dresser and a cool lamp or two. User 11: I would store/lose the mirror over the dresser and then center it under the window that's on the right. Flip the bed so the head is where the dresser used to be and put the armoire facing the foot of the bed. I would replace the curtains with something lighter or put in white shutters or wooden blinds, and try to find some soft, fluffy bedding that's got warm tones and texture in it. User 12: I second removing the mirror! It's making the dresser look heavier than it is. Freeing up some wall space means OP could hang the pictures on the wall, too. OP: Genius. I never even considered getting rid of the mirror. It's a part of the dresser, but obviously we don't have it connected or even hanging on the wall yet. Thank you! User 13: Exactly what I was going to suggest! And paint the walls a more neutral color but add color to the soft furnishing... some big pillows, a nice duvet cover.... User 14: I would paint the walls. User 15: Personally, I'd paint the walls and trim a nice neutral color (like Behr- Spun wool?), and then sand down/repaint the furniture pieces a nice muted semi-neutral color, like an olive or grey-blue! I feel like it'd really brighten up the room & bring some new life to the older looking furniture pieces! :)   Other than that though, declutter a tad, some new curtains, and a picture or two on the wall maybe? User 16: Yes! Do this! Put the bed under the window. Scoot the dresser over so it’s centered on the wall and move the armoire over to where the bed is in the photo.    You could also paint the furniture to a lighter color so it doesn’t feel so overwhelming in the room. Swap the pulls and knobs for something less tardy looking and that should help brighten up the space. User 17: Why do you say you’re stuck with the furniture? You can’t sell it? User 18: I would get some nice bedding, try to de clutter the top of the furniture and maybe add some wall decorations. And of course plants! User 19: 1) rearrange furniture if possible to break up chunky stuff 2) get nice bedding, maybe a white duvet/cover 3) make sure you have table/desk lamps to turn on at night, makes things much cozier! 4) texture always helps - some velvet or faux fur pillows User 20: Definitely lighter curtains, a more refined neutral bedding User 21: As a former homeless person, I would learn to love the furniture. OP: Thank you, I'm forcing myself to love it by never getting rid of it. ;) User 22: Put a plant between the two big pieces of furniture. It will open the space.        Bed skirts. Maybe move the bed under the window? And a puff, [something like this]([URL] or a cute chair. User 23: If you turned the bureau 90 degrees, it would be just too wide for the space between the corner and the window, correct?  Other than moving furniture, I would focus on color and adding a lot of plush bedding. I wouldn’t rule out putting bold wallpaper on the wall with the dresser (if you can’t hide it, make it a feature) or the wall where your headboard is. (And if you don’t have a headboard, get one.)  The rug is a good neutral to build off of. Think about colors that go with the wood tones (ochre, navy, etc) and what style you like (modern, traditional, etc.).  Paint the other walls something cleaner and neutral. Some wallpaper ideas (sorry about the prices, find a style you like and then shop around for price and similar):  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  Simplify the curtains by using left-and-right hanging arrangement. If you need more privacy, look into wood slat blinds or layer sheets.  Bedding is going to give you the biggest bang for you buck, cost-wise. Layer up your bed with new duvets, a bed skirt, and a headboard.   If you do not use the ceiling fan, consider replacing it with a new fixture.   Drum / traditional: [URL] ; [URL] ; [URL]  Or, look for bladeless ceiling fans or ones with retractable blades that fold in when not in use.  Post updates!  — This is way too funky / modern but I just had to throw it in: [URL] User 24: Change paint color, get new curtains. Remove mirror from dresser, it just adds bulk. Try decluttering the top of dresser too User 25: I would take the mirror off the long dresser.  It'll give you more options of places to put it if you don't have to find a spot that fits the mirror. User 26: It looks like the mirror is not part of the furniture set.  So I'd either get rid of it or switch it for something gold/brass framed. User 27: Here's what I personally would do: Paint the walls white or cream; the blue clashes with the wood.  Replace curtains with floor length sheer white.  New comforter or duvet for the bed in a light color and add a bed skirt so you can't see what's underneath.  Clear off all the items on the furniture - if you have a lot of pictures, maybe do a gallery wall behind the bed?  Replace the dresser mirror with a modern round mirror and hang it on the wall.  Add a coordinating rug.  And a couple plants.  I know you hate the furniture but the wood looks top quality and I think if you used a natural color palette of cream/green or something like that it would blend in much better. User 28: The furniture is fine, I'd paint it white, but that's what I do with everything. My main opinion is, if you hate it, get rid of it. Why can't you sell it? User 29: Painting the walls white will help make it more cozy. Making the furniture a lighter color might soften the room a bit. You don't have to buy new furniture you can paint and stain the darker wooden to make it lighter User 4: How do you stain dark wood to make it lighter? User 30: I'd get rid of the mirror and put a big painting or print in.  I find Andrew Wyeth's \"Master Bedroom\" super soothing. User 31: I'd position the bed in the corner if possible. Then put the long dresser  on the wall where the bed is now. Or. take off the mirror and put the dresser under the window? User 32: Paint the walls olive green or ink black. Bring in brass accents and tropical house plants. Maybe a Persian rug. User 33: * do you have to keep all these pieces in the same room?  Could one become an armoire in the dining room or something? * are you opposed to painting any of the pieces?  Matte black/navy and new hardware could go a long way (especially on a relocated piece) * could you get rid of at least the mirror and hang a circular gold mirror in its place? * consider painting the walls a pale sage or a creamy white (like navaho white) * consider new curtains.  They are hung at a perfect height, but the brown overwhelms the room with the cherry furniture * declutter the top of the cherry furniture OP: Thank you for validating my curtain height. :) Husband was critical that they were too high! What color curtains would you do? We prefer sun-blocking ones because our bedroom faces east. User 34: An option is also to have a sun blocking roller curtain or similar mounted inside the window frame and then have curtains that don't need to be sun-blocking User 35: Can you sand / paint / change hardware ? If not I would go for a cosy hog warts library vibe User 36: Paint every thing in neutral colors. Make the bed with good linens like you would see in a hotel. That means bedskirt or wrap, throw pillows and something to emphasize the head .... A fabric headboard can be diy'd easily. Curtains or cushions could be used. If you can't sell and replace the furniture paint it white, gray or black so it is cohesive and blends with whatever you chose for walls. The less colors  you have over all, the less chaotic it will look. User 37: The blue van be changed into a nice warm color. Maybe beige or forest green User 38: Put a rug under the bed, paint the room a darkish green and get cream curtains. Get a nice bed frame. User 39: If the furniture isn't antique, I would paint it all white and then 'age' the paint a bit. User 2: I actually really like the blue walls, but I’m not sure I’m very good at paint colors. But you could sand and stain the furniture to something darker and less 90s, keep the walls blue, and swap the curtains for light, airy white. I would then trade the drawer pulls for another shape. I know you would probably have to keep the hardware on the cabinet with the key under the mirror, so I would try to keep that and just update the rest of the pulls with something that is still brass but looks newer.  I might even lean Victorian with a bold floral somewhere in the room. OP: Ah, thank you on your idea to keep the blue walls. I don't necessarily love the color, but I'd like to avoid painting if possible. Googling new drawer pulls now... ;) User 40: Google ways to modernize old furniture. There are ideas worth checking out others haven't mentioned here.  I agree with all other suggestions already mentioned. But I would prioritize the wall color and whether or not you wish to modernize the furniture.  I would put some furniture coasters under the legs of the big furniture. Seems like the carpet will be permanently impressed in the future.   Could out a rug under the big furniture.   If you get ride of the mirror, keep the mirror and find a different frame to repurpose it. This goes in hand with modernizing the mirror.\n",
            "User 10 - n0nayb Original Post: What colour to paint this garden wall? Image: a brick courtyard in a house with a red door and red fire hydrant. User 1: Looks amazing as it is to be honest. Maybe make small additions, like mirrors or allow moss to grow. User 2: No don't paint this...don't touch it.  It's charming.  ETA: since this is a north facing wall, I would grow moss on it.  SOME moss, not a lot, but it takes a while to grow anyway.  There's recipes online...I believe it's buttermilk and moss in a blender then spread it where you want it to grow. User 3: This is totally off topic but what does ETA mean in this context? I’ve only ever known it as estimated time of arrival. I’ve seen it used this way a lot recently. User 4: Edited to add User 3: Thanks! User 5: How do you know it’s north facing User 6: Because OP said as much in their comment below :) User 7: I don’t have a colour suggestion, although I think it’s more calling for a mural.. but you can get window mirrors like the below which would open up the space.. [URL] OP: I like the idea of mirrors (I’m gonna get some to put on the bricked up windows in the wall to the left, you can’t really see them tucked in the ivy in this pic) but I feel like on that wall they would just reflect back at my house’s back wall... unless they were slightly pointed skyward maybe? Hmmm, thank you for the suggestion? User 7: Yeah, they are better with foliage over them as they look less obviously like mirrors then. By they way download the dulux visualiser app, this will allow you to virtually paint the wall, yellow might look quite good and bring a bit of sunshine to the wall, but it’s more about the look you are going for really OP: I’m in Ireland, and my garden is basically the ruins of the house that used to be behind/perpendicular mine - old stone walls on either side, with a large concrete wall that is part of my neighbour’s house. So it’s not technically a ‘room’ anymore, but it still has the fireplace and windows from when it was a living room. I need to clean up the ivy a little to stop damage to their wall and roof, so it’s a chance to get that wall power washed and painted.... but what colour?  This photo is facing south - so that wall is facing north, and so it’s in shade all day. I’m thinking a modern sort of grey or dark green would work well with the ancient stone walls on either side and highlight the plant life I want to put in there... any ideas? User 8: Check that it's legally yours to paint before you do anything.   It might be in your garden, but it may be fully owned by your neighbour. Where we used to live one of our house walls was the neighbours garden wall and (after some nonsense with them trying to trellis over one of our windows) we found that we had 100% ownership of the wall and they couldn't do anything to it without our explicit permission. User 9: Glidden Pale Jade. User 10: A dark charcoal grey would be perfect. It'll add more depth and make anything you place against it (like the green leaves or red door) pop even more. User 11: Don't you even dare!  It's perfect User 12: I like a white wash for that, but without harming the Ivy, would be tricky, better to leave or decorate with more wall hanging plants User 13: What about a yellow? User 14: I like the idea of a darker teal or a deep sea blue, then add natural wood elements and climbing plants/trellis.  Would climbing variegated climbing hydrangea work for your climate?  Please keep us updated on what you decide upon! User 15: White or maybe power wash it User 16: I really like it as it is! Agree about adding decor items and/or moss User 17: I wouldn't. It looks very cool as is. Maybe add some metal artwork to the wall. User 18: [Pressure wash it]([URL]  I've heard of people using wallpaper specifically designed for outdoors to put up murals but I've got no idea how much it would cost. Unless you are wanting to do some intricate stenciling I'd be talking to local artists. User 19: If you do I think something like teal or middle blue not too dark or light.it’s really beautiful as is though!\n",

User 1: Oml why would they put the thermostat there 😩 OP: Yeah... House was built in the early 70’s. Thermostat aside, I lucked out with a really open floor plan for a house built in that era. User 2: You could mount a painting or some art in front of it with 3m command strips/velcro, just make sure there's a gap between the wall and thermostat,  would not be too difficult to get to it when you need it.  It would also fill up the empty space, maybe painting or (maybe framed) lp cover over each tower?  Also if you have the time and budget, [there's  a way ]([URL] to make acoustic panels with prints on them. Haven't tried it myself though. Edit: typo OP: Thanks for the thoughtful response! I’ll update when I do something with it. User 3: Someone deserves a Batman-slapping-Robin for putting that there. User 4: Hop on Etsy and get some prints. You could make a gallery wall with all the prints if you wanna really fill out the wall. OP: Never thought of Etsy, thanks for the suggestion! User 5: those floating ikea boxes you mount to the wall, use them to house your records. plus any prints would be nice as well. OP: Floating boxes are a unique idea, storage AND style in one! Thanks! User 6: Whatever you do, you're gonna wanna do something asymmetrical. I don't see the thermostat as that big of an issue, really.  I'd start with a lamp or something in the corner. And balance that with a larger print on the left. Then a couple of smaller prints on the right to connect the two. Then I'd space out your speakers (you're probably gonna want a wider soundstage, anyhow), move the stereo over to the left, & figure out some vinyl storage for center. And then rugs always help.  Super quick mockup: [[URL] OP: Wow, thanks for the suggestions and the mockup! You’ve gone above and beyond here! I love the lamp idea, the rug is a great suggestion too (this wall is near the front entry to my house).\n",

User 2: Curly hair, or a cute bun with a pin.   I see either really nice V silver necklace or big  bold earings with this.  Looks great!

OP: That's a pretty solid direction to go in.   Thank you very much!!  User 3: Silver jewelry! Wear the black bracelet you’re wearing in the pic with a few other silver ones.

And the makeup, I’d do a neutral gold eyeshadow look with a lip that matches your dress. OP: I love that idea! Old Hollywood is such a great vibe. Thank you for your suggestion!

Last two pics are the kind of look I want to go for (and have way too big hips/ waist for 🙃) Image: the four pictures show what to wear with old jeans. OP: I have quite literally never owned a pair of jeans in my life that I’m comfortable in / fit well and look good before, so I am endeavouring to fix that. Open to any advice from those that understand the ways of jeans 😂 User 1: Love A! I agree with you as I’m not a fan of paper bag either but with the belt you can’t tell! I’d recommend Rebellious Fashion for jeans similar to the style pics at the end. Also ASOS and Stradivarius ☺️ OP: Tysm I’ll have a look into them ! I definitely think I’m leaning towards A as my favourite pair, B just .. the whole tight at the top thing and then loose at the bottom doesn’t look right to me ? User 1: I like B too, they really flatter your legs! I always have to try new clothes on a couple times before deciding. Try styling with a few different tops and outfits - always gives a good indication of whether they’ll fit in your wardrobe and you’ll wear them.  If you’re still not sure if you love, send them back. If you don’t love trying them on, you won’t wear once the tags are off! You can always re order if you change your mind :) OP: Yeah I’m definitely going to have to have a bit of a play around with B to see if I can make them work. Trying them with a mix of different shirts is definitely a good shout ! OP: I do love the jeans in the last two pics but I have chonky hips and thighs so I doubt they’d ever look like that on me User 1: And noooo! It’s all about finding a brand that works for you! Jeans are so different from everywhere you buy and it’s definitely worth ordering from a couple different places to find a pair that suit you and you feel comfortable in. OP: I may or may not have just ordered £100 worth of jeans off ASOS to have a play around with 😅 the joy of free returns User 1: Enjoy! I love new clothes orders 🤩 User 2: I really like B! Where are they from? OP: They’re from TKMaxx (uk version of TJmaxx from what I can tell) but are originally river island brand (: I do like them I’m just a bit uncertain about how they look around the crotch area, kind of.. bagging up in lines ? I don’t know the technical term lol. But I’m not sure if it’d a good look or not User 2: Ah I love river island jeans! I see what you're saying but I thought they had the best fit esp around your hips. Personally, I prefer jeans to be a little more fitted around the shins too which is why I liked B. Which ones do you feel most comfortable in though? OP: These were my first pair of non-primark jeans hehe. I’m more comfortable in A (not a massive fan of the Paperbag waist look but I think I could get used to it) but might end up keeping A and B because they were only £10 each. User 1: 2, 5 and 6 User 3: you should try the asos design balloon leg jeans! ive never found a pair of jeans that fit before these so now i have 5 pairs lol. theyre nice high quality stiff denim with a relaxed leg fit but tapered towards the ankle, really high waisted and actually have enough room in the hips/bum/thighs that i can buy my true waist size and they fit perfect! for reference im 29” waist, 38” hips and large bum and thighs, and i still have room to spare in the hips/bum/thighs! OP: Ooooh could you drop a link ? They sound perfect 👀 User 3: sure here you go! they also have them in other colours, lengths and body types (regular/petite/curve/tall) - [URL]    just so you know, i fluctuate between a waist of 28”-30” depending on the day/bloating etc and i bought the 28” waist jeans because i when got the 30” ones at christmas they relaxed with wear and have become too big! the waist 28” ones were a bit too tight at first but have now relaxed to fit perfectly, hopefully thatll help you with sizing! they are a stiff 100% cotton denim so they have no stretch but relax and become looser and softer with wear and washing :) if you happen to be a waist 30-32” ill happily sell you my old ones cheap 😁 OP: I am a 30-32 !!

Beige with chrome handles OP: Thank you. I did think about it but we both don’t like to darken the space any more. So decided to  not do black. User 5: Check out Benjamin Moore Hale Navy. It would go well with everything you already have! OP: Thank you. I like this. User 6: I wouldn't paint the cabinets. I would paint the walls instead. I would also change the pulls. OP: Thanks. What style pulls are you thinking? User 6: Brass country style maybe. User 6: Or a more decorative chrome that could potentially pull attention away from the dark cabinets. User 7: I like the color :) keep the cabinets, change the counters, regrout the black splash with a light gray OP: Thank you. We haven’t fully decided yet to do the cabinets. Might end up just keeping them as is. User 8: This is the answer! The counter top is busy, and clashes with both the cabinets and back splash. User 9: Totally agree.  Don't ruin the cabinets be painting them.  It is not an improvement. User 10: Exactly! It is a loverly rich colour. I would only change the countertops with white marble top and install brass hardware. And a bright light runner :) OP: Benjamin Moore Swiss Coffee User 11: Cadet Blue (grayish blue) User 12: With all the other browns in that kitchen, and with stainless appliances, you can't go grey or black. It will just look like you painted because you hated the wood tones, instead of painting to make it look better.  Your floors and counter control your choices here.  Your grey wall color is causing some confusion right now too. Change that.   A pale buttery yellow will work or sage green will work for cabinets. OP: Thank you. It may not look like it but the granite and floor does have gray patterns. When we bought the house the walls were a dark beige which we hated. We changed those to Agreeable Gray as soon as we could. It has a slight warmth to it. Building on that gray I was hoping the Intellectual Gray cabinets would work because that color also is warm and I can see that color in the granite and floor. User 12: But the gray pattern in your floors and counters is not what you see when you walk into the room.   Just because gray is a decorating trend doesn't mean it has to be done. You have other choices. Your cabinet faces are not particularly \"modern\" so painting them will not make them that way. It will only make them more pleasant to look at. OP: Thank you. Makes sense. I am only trying to make it look a bit more pleasing/modern while minimizing cost. I am not a fan of the floors, granite and cabinet shape. But changing any of those is significantly more expensive than refinishing/painting the cabinets and hence considering the latter. User 12: I understand.   I am sometimes slow to make decisions about design because I'm so obsessive about getting it right. I argue with myself about spending money when sometimes there is really nothing else you can do but bite the bullet. I don't like to throw good money or time and energy after bad either.  But if I can get the look I want, it doesn't have to be someone else's definition of perfect.  Either way, I always approach the project with sensibility. I don't get hung up on brands or trends.  I set out to get my look sensibly.    One of the largest expenses in a kitchen redo is relocation of plumbing, gas lines, and electric. You can save a lot of money if you like the kitchen layout and leave appliances and sinks where they are   People these days are ripping out perfectly good solid wood cabinets from the 90's. When I say perfectly good, I mean solid boxes that aren't pulling away from the walls, aren't split along hinges or the grain, aren't water damaged, and don't have sagging shelves.  In these cases, I think it's better to reface than paint. But that's me. An alternative would be professional painting where the current finish is stripped down to the wood. Another alternative is to have a cabinet maker strip your cabinet boxes down to the bare wood and build new doors.  Changing counters is just expensive and there is no way around this. Tile floors can be tiled over and that may be cheaper than you think.   You said you want modern. There's really no way to get modern design with the counters and floors that you have. That doesn't mean they are ugly or hopeless. There is a way to get a lighter and more pleasing room.  It's just how much do you want to spend now, and are you going to feel bad later (when you actually redo the entire kitchen) about this interim cash you are spending.   The cheapest way to live with your kitchen right now is embrace the brown. I stand by repainting the walls.  Gray has no place in this room.  Perhaps the walls should be a buttery yellow. If the cabinets are in good condition, have a professional repaint them. Use a bluish green pale sage color. Paint the island in a slightly darker shade of yellow than the walls. Or, reverse this color combinations with pale green walls, darker green island and yellow paint on the cabinets.  Your alternative is a gut and redo. OP: Thank you very much for the detailed response. Much appreciated. I am still on the fence about this project. Did not know the tile floors could be tiled over. Will definitely explore that option - I believe that will be money well spent if I choose to go with a more modern style as it will uplift the entire space (not just the kitchen) and pave the way more cabinet paint options down the lane. Thanks again! User 12: [URL] User 3: I have also seen people use specialty paint and add stencils that really update the space.  Perhaps a while paint stencil to neutralize the brown?  Then lean into Scandinavian neutrals with the rest of your kitchen? User 13: A modern grey/blue might go with the fridge without compromising the warmth in the other colours of the space OP: Whenever a question like this comes along, it's always a good idea to ask yourself if you would be adding to the value of the house, or taking away from it.  These are nice cherry cabinets that people pay a premium for.  The \"painted\" cabinets that you see in the stores are not cherry...they're cheap wood...  If you're wanting a change, you might consider the granite... OP: Thank you User 14: To much time on your hands? Those are nice cabinets and don't need to change User 15: Dusty blue User 16: Paint them. They look like they are in great shape, so why tear out perfectly solid cabinet doors? You can change up the door pulls after. I had solid oak cabinets that were in great shape . I didn’t like the stain colour , so I had them professionally painted white. Love them now:) OP: That's exactly what I am planning to do. Just need help to decide the right color. Here's the other side of the kitchen - [[URL] User 17: Slate grey or blue User 3: I would leave the cabinets, but change the floor and countertop.  You can likely sell the existing countertops to help with some of the cost.  I would put in new whiter/lighter ones.  Then do the floor later as you have the budget.  Think about swapping the cabinet pulls for something more modern - black, brass, etc.  If you would consider plants, I would place some in coordinating pots at the top of the upper cabinets. OP: Thank you. I didn’t consider flooring yet as I was under the assumption it requires removal of existing tiles, which is cost prohibitive and messy. Just learned today that I can tile over tile. Definitely going to explore that option User 18: You can’t tile over tile, but you can put a floating vinyl floor over tile. Search for luxury vinyl tile (or plank, if you want wood in there instead).   Source: I sell flooring. OP: Thank you so much. I am only looking for wood-looking vinyl flooring, not real wood. Do you think that could be installed over these tiles? If so, how do they manage the space under the doors? User 18: Depending on what you do, it really only adds about 1/4”. Usually your floors have enough of a gap. What kind of flooring do you have adjacent to the kitchen? Would you consider running the flooring throughout the whole level? User 18: I’ve read through all the comments and don’t agree with a lot of them. I feel like you can definitely go grey in here. I sell flooring and I’m trained to see the undertones in different materials and I definitely see grey in your countertops and flooring. Especially with the stainless steel, I think grey would be fine. Comments suggesting yellow or sage seem really out of sorts and will likely date the kitchen more than it is now and not work with the rest of the house.   I don’t mind your wall color. It’s very neutral and warm still. Countertops would be a good change, but that’s also very expensive. Dark cabinets are out of style right now and I don’t think they are coming back any time soon, so painting them wouldn’t be the worst idea.   I think the color you picked out would be nice. I’d maybe suggest doing it only on your bottom cabinets and do a lighter color on your uppers. Or a different island color (like a forest green?) to add some more interest to the room. I think just adding some color to the room would be a major help, regardless.   I also don’t hate your cabinet pulls. They are still modern.   Another alternative would be to only paint the island cabinets. Would be cheaper and add a needed update way easier. Eventually you can change the countertops to something else, and if you’re tired of the paint color then, paint it something else!   Good luck! OP: Thank you so much. Needed to hear this. As you rightly said, there definitely is a gray in the floor and countertops, but the pictures are probably not showing it well. This is the specific reason why I picked a warm gray (SW Intellectual Gray) for the cabinets. I am not sure whether to use that color or maybe go a step lighter.   I am also going to look at the vinyl over tile option for flooring. User 18: Sherwin Williams has a great visualizer where you can paint specific parts of your own pictures using their tools. I’d mess around with it. Try just painting the uppers, all, just the island, a different combination, etc.   The kicker with using these tools is that your current colors aren’t going to look in the computer how they look in person. I’d retrace the walls using the tools and put in Agreeable Grey, then do the walls and doors in a white. This well help give you a more true image of what the colors you choose for the cabinets would look like in person. User 19: I think a dark blue or black would really look good in there. Maybe with copper handles for the dark blue and chrome or brass handles for the black. OP: Thank you. We did think about it but decided to go a bit lighter. Hence the gray color. User 20: Navy blue!  Alternatively, switch to white stone countertops. User 21: I wouldn't paint the cabinets any color except \"black\" or \"white\". Almost everything else is forcing it and will be out of style in a few years anyway. Your countertops and floor are less up to date than your cabinets and while PITA to change,  you will get more usability by concentrating there. If you make changes now to \"match\" an already out of date flooring, later on you will have to change both. User 22: Thst sounds really good. The current colour is definitely not great User 23: Here you go - [URL]\n",

OP: I'm in a rental, the office/desk is built in, so I'm limited there. The side of the \"T\" is my space I'm limited to.  Any of the random blurring you see are my attempts to maintain some degree of anonymity.  Things you can't see atm:  Laptop, docked behind the smaller monitor  Xbox series X, behind the right monitor.     {edit: so the REAL purpose of my post is just to ask where you would rearrange things, with or without more accessories, if this was your space}} User 1: Two words my friend: seven slammers OP: I don't follow... User 2: Just commenting on the Xbox wireless headset.   Mine didn’t wake up until I downloaded and installed the Dolby atmos to configure them. OP: Ah. Mine have pretty much worked out of the box User 2: Mine always worked but configuring with Dolby Atmos really made them sound great User 3: The left monitor is too close to the wall,  I would shift both to the open side of the desk.  But that may not work with the rest of the room.   You could rotate the smaller monitor 180 too OP: I don't think the perspective gives the location of the monitor a right idea of how it is, but as it isn't VESA I'll need to get an adapter for a monitor arm. I haven't learned if I can rotate it. It's not my monitor, landlord just told me to use it.  I've considered moving the monitor to the other side of my console monitor though.   I like the office space in theory, but it's not to my liking. I'm not able to cut into it or modify it structurally.   Sigh User 3: Can you move the second monitor to set it above the first, maybe a small shelf?    I just think that the cramped environment plays poorly with working, but if you can work with it.    Good luck. OP: I can't put the monitor above, cabinet it right out of the shot. I don't\"work\" from home, do optimal convenience is priority or productivity. I do mostly console gaming and streaming on the right, and discord, general life stuff on the left monitor.   I did find that I was able to get a VESA adapter and I can rotate orientation. I've ordered that and a dual monitor arm, so there's opportunities there OP: I posted an update in case you hadn't seen it!\n",
            "User 19 - krwj75 Original Post: How can we make this loft at the top of the stairs a bit more homey with some mid century modern furniture? Image: an empty room with an empty wall and floor. User 1: Reading nook! Reading nook! Reading nook!  Pop a couple bookcases and a cushy chair + footstool + floor lamp + some art and you're gold. User 2: Some big bookcases would help this space a lot. I think it's too bright and clinical but a couple big bookcases, softer lighting, and some furniture in a dark jewel tone would help the space feel like a moody little mini library full of shoes. Which honestly sounds like my dream room. OP: Are you thinking book cases on the right that surround a seat or two with ottomans? User 1: Yeah I'm thinking one bookcase per wall and then a little central seating area! But whatever works! OP: This area is about 20ft by 15ft rectangle with entrances to the other rooms at two of the corners as seen. The picture is from the top of the stairs. Unfortunately, we need to consider a shoe rack with a bunch of shoes somewhere as well and this area seems the most spacious for it. There are about 50 shoes in boxes.   We were thinking of how to transform this area to a reading room like feel with a couch and foot rest and lamp or something along those lines. Maybe some sort of art on the long walls. Our budget would be no more than $1200. Thanks for your suggestions! User 3: 50 boxes of shoes is a lot. Do you already have the shoe rack, or will that need to come out of the budget? User 4: I’m chuckling at 50 *pairs* of shoes being *a lot*. OP: Haha I’m sure some people have way more but it seems like a lot when trying to figure out it’s home in this space. OP: We have a simple metal shoe rack right now. If we reuse it then it wouldn’t come out of the budget. User 5: Ok, due to the size of the space and your style of choice I would keep things simple and minimalistic. I would recommend painting that wall we see on the left a bold, interesting color as an accent wall. And a couch on the right. A light brown leather is what I am picturing, with a lattern/textured ottoman. As far as lighting, maybe consider mounted lighting on either side of the sofa? This again frees up some space and will make the room feel larger, elegant, and cozy.  Wall art for sure!    Are the shoes meant for storage or display? That effects things.  I love this project! If you are interested in pictures of what I am saying specifically, feel free to message. Otherwise no worries.   Good luck 😊 OP: I’d say half of the shoes could be part of a display but some are older and probably better suited to stay in their boxes.   I’d love to take a look at some pictures if you are able to easily put it together. I really appreciate the insight! User 6: You can mount some closed shoe storage on the walls. Something like Ikea Trones [[URL] or similarly thin to maximise your space. Then put a nice chair like this [[URL] a lamp and a plant. I'm just using Ikea because I don't know any American shops.  But if it's for reading, are you going to have books? OP: I really like that chair! I’m grateful you shared the link to IKEA since I didn’t even know they had that. The closed shoe storage is interesting and I’ll have to think about it some more.   We don’t have many books and most of our reading are on e-readers. We could probably display some items on the shelves if we don’t have enough books.   Thanks again for the feedback! User 7: Seems like you have plenty of room to build an actual closet with shelves for the shoes (and whatever else you want). Some drywall, 2x4s, trim, and paint would set you back less than $100 and add some resale value (who *doesn't* want more storage). You'll still have plenty room for a desk or reading nook.  Not sure if I would put the closet on the wall straight ahead or the one to the left. Depends on which would work better for the traffic flow of the space. User 8: Maybe some softer lighting, would you consider painting the walls? Floating shelves, nice round rug and some bookshelves? Maybe put some plants around too! [Like these]([URL] OP: I love the plants idea. We have some already and never really thought about putting it in this space before. We have mostly been trying to put them near windows so far but it could be a possibility if we start to use some imagination. Thanks!! User 9: It would be a good choice to hang [modern canvas art]([URL] on the empty wall OP: Do you think this would be best on the left or right long wall? Or even the far wall if it’s a little empty? User 9: Relatively large wall\n",
            "User 20 - jto6xc Original Post: Help designing my dining room as a space to gather! Image: a big house with a huge wooden floor, stairs, and windows. User 1: This is pretty minimal as of right now. It can go in a lot of directions, what look/style are you going for? OP: Hi! as I put in my comment, we're trying to go for a modern alpine chalet style. I know that's not really a thing... We're drawing some inspiration from this book: [URL] but there are a lot of ways that this can go. The overall home is built in a classic bavarian chalet style by a guy from Germany. We'd like to keep the character of that, but not the folksy-ness of it - we'd prefer to modern it up, use more clean lines. User 2: I didn’t know this style was a thing and I LOVE it!! Thank you for introducing me to it ☺️ User 1: You can definitely keep the rocker chair, maybe dress it up with a plaid blanket or pillow.   Are you planning on a TV or is that a TV on the left-hand side of the picture? If it is, I would place it center on that wall with a nice fireplace entertainment center beneath it. If it isn't, a nice picture frame tv would be nicely mounted as if it were a fireplace and have it display a fire when not in viewing use.   A bench with pillows that you see in a lot of the photos can be placed on the barrier \"wall.\" Opposing it (wall with windows) can be a cozy couch that fits in the aesthetics you already have going. The center of the floor can either have one of the fur rugs you see in a lot of the photos or a generally plain rug. On top of the rug, you can have a chest (functions as a coffee table) or a minimalist coffee table.   I wouldn't really hang any decorations, there's already a lot of nice views/woodwork going on and you don't want to distract from that beautiful charm. OP: Hi there,  The rocker won't stay in this room when it becomes the dining room unless there is a real reason to keep it here. We can move it downstairs to the living room or to one of the bedrooms.   There is already a sitting room/living room/den downstairs with all the traditional stuff - couches, chairs, TV, fireplace. User 1: WHOOSH on reading dining room for me XD OP: Ha! No worries! I'd be happy to hear your dining room suggestions :) User 1: From the pictures you've provided, the second picture works for the area. Bench on the sides with the windows/open wall to keep the area open feeling.  I would opt for another neutral/plain rug under the table since chairs can really scuff the flooring. Make sure the rug extends far enough out for the chairs to slide in and out on top of the rug. If you're not a fan of the benches, the third picture also works since the chairs all have low backs. Basic takeaway, keep the view as open as possible. User 3: No pointers lol - but what an awesome space!!! 😍😍😍😍  ETA - Ok I have a pointer - WHITE (faux) fur rugs, lots of cozy blankets and pillows and fluffy, fuzzy otomans/chair. Oh and fairy lights make everything so warm and glowy. OP: Hello! We've done that type of decor in my daughter's bedroom in this house - lots of faux fur pillows and rug, soft cool colors, cozy blankets and pillows, fuzzy ottoman - you nailed it!  No fairy lights... I should definitely do that for her. In this dining room though? Not as certain about the stuff that will be hard to clean food out of! User 3: Ahhh! I'm so sorry, I didn't read and realize it was  to be a dining room!!! Lol I was picturing a family room. My bad! Ironically though I worked on a set tonight where they had faux fur table runners across their dining room table and was so beautiful. If too much while eating, just take off. But we're not eating at dining table much of our day. They also had (I swear, not associated, I had to look at bottom of candle to see where from) these awesome flameless candles that looked SO real (from a fee or two away), from Luminara. BUT dining table over a big faux fur rug, with the faux fur runner? OP: Well, you DEFINITELY nailed the look we used in my daughter's room, and that we will probably riff on in the family room, so kudos - you know what we're after!  I love the idea of the faux fur table runners. We actually have a breakfast bar in the kitchen (for now... until we redo the kitchen at least) so I foresee this room as being the \"everything else room\". Homework/school work. Games. dining table, huge dining table for someday when we can host again... so the faux fur table runners actually would work pretty well most of the time!   Great tip on the candles - I have a feeling these will \"warm\" up many of our spaces! User 4: If you don't mind what's your profession? How did you get into it? User 3: Hi! This was random help for my husband's friend who is a TV producer. He asked if I could come help him with setting some stuff up (basically, make it pretty) because they know I have experience with event planning and love that shit. In general though, I'm a \"C-Level Executive Assistant\" which over the years, and with working at several different types of companies, has made me wear many different \"hats,\" one being the event planning stuff. Basically, as an EA, you have to be willing and ready to do it all, big or small. The setting up events (whether it's a corporate conference or a weekend retreat) was always my favorite part though. :) User 5: Start with the floors - which look like it could use a cleaning. Or better yet a sanding. If that’s not possible, clean, wax, then get some nice rugs, one for the main area and another smaller one at the top of the stairs to cover all the scuff marks.  Medium wood dining table that fills the room, with leaves so you can expand it for large gatherings- not recommended for now, what with COVID. Cover or upholster the dining chairs in a nice color like green.  Then some nice white sheer curtains that drop to the bottom of the windows not the floor as it looks like you have heating registers. OP: Thanks! The floors have been cleaned - they definitely need to be sanded and refinished - they have water damage and scuffing from years of neglect (we just bought it). Unfortunately, we'll have to wait on that project since the wood floor stretches all through the house and will need to be done all at once. We won't get to this right away.  The dining table I'm having built will actually be a modular table, so rather than leaves we'd have two smaller tables that can be added to the main one either banquet style (long) or conversational style (square). I linked a design in my top comment.   What would be considered \"medium wood\"?  We are looking for suggestions on dining chairs that will be comfortable for long sits. Will keep your recommendation of covers/upholstery in mind. User 6: CAn you show where you are building your table please OP: Here is a sketch of where I think the 3-part modular table could be set up and the various configurations we would use. [URL]  Note that the fan is centred in the section of the room bounded by the stairs to the lower level, so I imagine that's where I would put a nice light fixutre (whether it's a fan or not)  The full room is 21' by 21', with a 10.5' by 8' space with the stairs and weird loft where my husband wants to put a fly tying setup. User 3: Hi! Me again! Haha. How long were you thinking of waiting to have your floors refinished? Asking bc my husband and I moved into our new home in June (from tiny NYC apt.) and tried to hold off on buying the bigger furniture items, really settling in, getting all the cute decor etc. until we had the floors redone bc removing and storing all that stuff elsewhere to have the floors done for a week or so...ughhh! OP: I have no idea when we'll get the floors done. There are a million things that need to be done in this house (it's a second home, major fixer upper) so despite how bad the floors look, they are functional and may stay like this until summer, or even longer... it's not a job I can do myself, and contractors are hard to find here... I have a million contractor jobs that I have to chip away at. There is a good chance that we won't do the floors until we're ready to do the kitchen since taking out the cabinets will make floor work a ton easier. User 7: This isn’t really about layout but I am wondering if it would be cool to have some hanging plants that grow downward to create kind of a a cascading living wall over on that open wall by the stairs (those are stairs right?). As a cool way to create a little more separation. Also I have a similar situation with my floors and yes I stare at them all the time hoping they magically get better but I know when I’ve saved up enough for the project they’re going to look amazing. In the meantime, rugs and call it rustic. OP: The floors are an eyesore, I know. Everyone says oh, but it's hardwood, you don't want to take that out (and they're probably right) but man, it's not the hardwood that I would have picked! I do intend to do a full refinishing eventually, but that is another set of hard decisions: What do I do about the one room that has carpet instead of hardwood? Do I pull the matching hardwood from the bottom floor sitting room and refloor down there as well? If so, then that's now TWO whole floors that I need to be worrying about all at once. Sigh. Buying a fixer upper like this, sometimes it's hard to know where to start, and how to \"scaffold\" the job. We intend to continue to improve over time, but ... I need a plan! User 8: This looks like an amazing space! Are you very tied to having a ceiling fan? If not, swapping that out with another light fixture could be a simple way to bring more of the modern feel you're looking for. Maybe something like [this]([URL] or whatever fits your style ! OP: Ooh - that's a pretty light fixture. I fear that it would be way too small for this room, though (11\" diameter light in a 22' x 14' room?). I need something that is going to take up space and shed a lot of light (otherwise I need to worry about secondary light sources like track lighting, which I'm not necessarily opposed to, but hadn't been considering so far). Also, there is no air conditioning in the house (we only get about a week or two per year when it is sweltering!), but the huge windows and glass patio doors (not shown here) also let in A LOT of sun/heat in the mid-day, even in winter. If I can find a great fan that fits the decor and also circulates the air, that would be really great. User 8: That's fair, I didn't check the dimensions but agree something bigger or multiple of them would be needed to fill the room with light. With or without it though, extra light sources are always a good way to add more dimension based on your style + adjust lighting for the vibe of a gathering! User 9: Your floors look like oak.  Fortunately, it's still available like this.  I've patched and matched in 2 different houses.  It works well, so don't worry about them looking somehow different when it does get done.  Sanded and finished you'll never know.  I'm assuming you want a multi purpose dining area.  I suggest a round/oval table with a leaf.  If you get four or six side chairs, your 2 end chairs can be more substantial and used elsewhere...a buffet is needed too..it can store linens/games/dishes...  I don't think I would put drapes in here... OP: Yup, they are definitely oak. But the extent of repairs needed to the floor (which stretches through the house) will require us to wait on the refinishing job. Maybe this summer!  Yes, if you look at the comment I made earlier we are hoping for this to be a multipurpose room, though there is a sitting room/living room/den downstairs with couches and fireplace, and where we will put the TV. I would like this room to be a place where multiple things can be happening at once. Maybe a conversation at one end of the table, a card game at another... maybe there is a puzzle or a boardgame in progress. If you look at my original comment you will see what I am going for table-wise - 3 tables which can be placed together to accommodate larger parties (someday!) or which can be moved to other parts of the room to accommodate varying needs. This room is very large, so a table that would only have six side chairs (three on each side) would look way too small. I'm thinking at this point that the main table will be 8' x 4'. with two 4' x 2' tables that can be placed at the ends or to the side (you'll have to check out the link I posted if that's not clear). I do need to figure out what to do for chairs. User 10: A big farm table [somethin like this]([URL]) Maybe take a look at a lodge type room OP: Hi! Yes, if you look at one of my other comments I posted two links to the inspiration for the table we're having built. I considered benches like in the link you shared, but I'm worried about that being really inconvenient and not super comfortable for long periods. I want this to be a place that people gather around the table and mingle and visit... so looking for chairs that are inviting and comfy! User 11: Agree with the other comments to start with refinishing the floors. Either restain or leave natural color. Neither choice would be wrong. You mentioned you already have a table picked out so next is to focus on accent furniture. I see two different floorplan directions you could take. First option, you could place two matching buffet cabinets under each window and leave the far wall for decorative accents (options could be hanging a large metal sculpture, \"installing\" faux/real fireplace, hanging several large paintings, or doing a combination with several open shelves). The second option would be to do a large furniture piece on the far wall somewhat off-centered so that you can also put a small bar cart there for after dinner drinks. Then, under each window, put matching narrow tables and decorate with various candles and fresh flowers. Both options give you extra storage for dishes and any seasonal table decorations. With either option, I'd also put drapes on the windows. Either a dark color if you go with light chairs or light sheers if you choose dark seating. Agree that chairs need to have arms and be comfortable because this is a space you want people to want to stay in. I'd have the head chairs in different fabric and different colors than the others. Whatever color the head chairs are, that's the same fabric color choice for the windows. For lighting, I'd hang two fairly large, matching light fixtures to help offset a long room and make the room feel more connected and cozy.Once you get these big pieces, accessorize with plants, candles, pillows and an area rug. OP: This is really great and practical input! Thank you!  Unfortunately, for a number of reasons (see other comments) the floors won't be refinished soon. Summer would be the earliest. But in the meantime, I need this room to start to come together and I need to make furniture choices!  I love the idea of the metal sculpture... There is already a large stone fireplace in the lower level living room space, so less inclined to put one up here.   We have lots of extra storage available elsewhere in the house, so those buffets you mention would probably end up housing puzzles and games. Haha.  Thanks for the chair suggestions - I love the idea of tying in the head chairs to the window treatments. Do you have any suggestions for chair style? It's so hard for me to know what's going to be comfortable when I can't go sit in anything! (we don't really have access to much in terms of furniture stores near here...) User 12: Use woods that match the ceiling I think:) OP: I'm pretty sure that's pine on the ceiling and I definitely don't want a softwood table. Plus, I'm worried about it looking weird on the orange-yellow oak flooring - not matchy-matchy but also not contrasting enough, you know? User 12: Oh lol I'm just thinking from your picture that keeping up the contrast and colour scheme in the room would look nice 🤔🤔 doesn't have to be the same wood but a similar darker kind of stain??? Or a totally different idea!! OP: Ah - are you referring to the beams? I'm definitely more on board with trying to match somewhat to the color of the beams! We were kind of thinking that already... our carpenter is asking us to choose a wood (maybe walnut?) and then we can stain it darker... User 9: a dining table would help......gather people......for dinner? User 13: I like it just the way it is..\n",

User 1: 👍 for the rug and the pendant light both.   Nicely done! User 2: I love everything! I would angle the chair such that you could put a lil end table in between them though... Also kinda wish the rug bigger, but not sure by how much lol... User 3: It's a really nice looking rug.  Have you found the flaw? ;-) OP: What do you mean by the flaw? The rug is hand made so it's not going to be completely straight in every corner and such! User 4: True Persian rugs will always contain one deliberately incorporated flaw. Reason being is that only god can make something perfect, never man. User 3: Exactly. By incorporating a deliberate (often nearly imperceptible) flaw, the weaver demonstrates humility to his fellow man and God. User 5: There should be two gold fans in the center of the border at the short ends. I would never have seen it if not for that comment. OP: Can you mark that up on the picture for me? can't see what you mean :) User 6: The rug shouldn't be touching the baseboard - I'd pull it out about 6+ inches, and maybe make it equidistant between tv stand and couch, just so it feels centered. OP: Done! If I understood correctly you wanted me to have rug more centered between the tv stand and couch? In the pic I posted I can see it's almost underneath the couch. It looks much better centered. Thanks a lot for the tip! User 6: Correct! Glad you like the change! And yeah, the other part of that was not having it touch the wall, so just scooting it out a few inches. User 1: It really ties the room together, dude. User 1: It really ties the room together\n",

Pull the rug further out from the couch. OP: Makes sense, thank you!! Glad I consulted this sub. I was thinking rectangle but was worried about walking into and scratching myself, a roundish shape makes a lot of sense User 4: Something round would work best for the L. User 5: Reasons? Idk anything but my first instinct would be a rectangle table. User 4: Easier to move around in tight space, feels more organic and cozy. User 6: How does shape of a table make it feel more organic? User 4: It just makes the space feel softer. How is this that hard to understand? User 6: Because that differs a lot from the definition of organic. User 7: Something like this would work well in this layout:    [URL]  It provides that organic layout mentioned. The term organic is commonly used in design to reference the nods to nature and natural materials. It includes but is not limited to materials, shapes, etc. When they said shapes they are referring to the fact that most organic things have a perfect balance of beauty and imperfections. A square table would not have due to it's rigid structured design. The L shape of the sofa and chaise would also work well in this setting so shins and knees don't accidentally slam the corners of a rectangular table.  Hope this helps, great set up so far! OP: Thanks!!! Very helpful User 4: Wasn’t talking about the literal definition. Not sure why you’re so stuck on this. Move along. OP: Thank you for the help.

User 1: If you can't find one, maybe go with wood. The contrast will be less stark. OP: Interesting. I hadn’t thought of this. I suppose a wood that kind of matches the cabinet?  User 1: Exactly. It will give a little bit of continuity in the different hues that are already in the bathroom. OP: Wait so would this be better looking than the mauve toilet seat completely?  User 2: Generally yes, since you’re matching to another fixture instead of matching to the overall hue of the room, which results in a very saturated visual effect  OP: Thanks so much for your input  OP: Do you think that the pink matching seat is ideal and the wood seat is second best looking? I’ve found a good match for the seat color I think but now I’m not sure what would look better  User 3: I think a matching seat would look best, but if it's not a perfect color match (and chances seen slim that it will be, but you never know) then it's going to look odd and you'd be better off with the contrast of wood.  OP: I totally agree that if the color isn’t a perfect match it will drive me crazy. I found the exact model of toilet and a company that claims to make toilet seats that match the exact color of that model but they are non returnable if it’s not a true match. Perhaps I’m safer getting a wood one.  User 4: I lived in a rental with avocado bathroom fixtures (to be fair, it was a...light avocado so came off more like a sage green and it wasn't that hideous.)  The landlord had replaced the seat with a black plastic (??) one and we went ahead and swapped it out for wood. It looked fine. But the benefit of either of these was the warmth.  OP: The wood is warmer or colder?  User 4: Warmer than a porcelain one. This was in the UK and the bathroom was chilly in the morning! User 5: How about gold? OP: In my search for the mauve toilet seat I discovered you can get toilet seats with flecks of gold inside  User 5: Yeah, I meant more like sold gold. Might look decent with the color scheme. Or at least look consciously ironic.  User 1: I agree with that. I think a match would be best but wood is a great second option. User 6: In my vast experience with weird coloured toilet seats, the colour tends to fade quite quickly. You may buy a dark pink seat but in 6 months or so you will be left with a light pink toilet seat.  User 7: This is what I was going to say as well. User 6: I’m not sure, but if you absolutely can’t find one, I would recommend.... gutting the whole bathroom and matching it to the white toilet seat.. haha OP: Lol. A totally reasonable suggestion if it wasn’t a rental!  User 8: What about taking the seat outside and spray painting it? User 9: I googled “vintage colored toilet seats” and got the following potential results:  [URL]  [URL]  I’m into vintage bathrooms and there are a lot of blogs out there on the topic with links on relevant vintage/salvage and reproduction fixtures.  Good luck! OP: Thanks very much! I think I actually found a really close match on plumbingsupply.com!  User 10: The 70’s? User 11: I think it was actually the 80s. My parents built their house in 85 and we have a mauve bathroom. And my mom SWEARS it was the style back then.  User 12: All of the fixtures in my restroom growing up were this color and our house was built in 1994.  User 13: Bemis is sold at almost every plumbing supply shop. They make a variety of color-match seats for vintage fixtures. Color samples are available on their website and at your local suppliers. They come in standard and elongated, depending on your bowl style, and all of them are soft close. User 14: Oh dear Gawd. You have my sympathy. If you cant find the right shade maybe you can go full on tacky and get one of those clear ones with fish in it?  User 15: Build.com has one in raspberry or loganberry that look like might be the same color but it’s almost $60 so.... 🤷‍♀️ OP: Thanks! I actually just came upon the same colors on plumbingsupply.com and I think raspberry looks like it’s a really close match. I appreciate you looking  User 16: You can try one of those transparent ones.  User 17: You might have to order a few but a quick search on Amazon results in several shades of purple or pink.  OP: None of the ones I have found online have looked close to this color. It’s a very unique color it seems. And i would want an exact match or it would look even odder I’d think  User 18: Get one that looks like wood. Probably easier. User 6: The horrors of the tile on tile on wood of that bathroom!

Seems to be Kohler in cranberry!  User 19: Primer and paint User 20: $100 for a new toilet, seat included.  User 21: Search for padded toilet seats; they come in a variety of “pleasant” colors, so you’ve got a good shot of finding something that could work, if not that exact shade.  I can think of a nice color for contrast... :) User 22: Probably a Goodwill type store User 23: Why bother if its a rental User 6: because just because you're renting doesn't mean you don't want to make it more cozy?

User 5: Some art work and maybe some plants. User 6: Every. Fucking. Time. User 7: Lol it should be in the rules: before making a post asking for advice, make sure you have covered the basics of plants, artwork, and a rug. User 8: If my room looked this amazing I think I’d have a better attitude about life User 9: Love it all. Great armoire.   Totally agree with popping artwork above bed. Personally, I will go with a painting, original and 1 big one as opposed to several smaller ones. Something personal…. Personally, I won’t do a plant. You have it already with your view.   Also agree with 2-3 things on the shelf above bed. Something that makes the room yours. Perhaps something with meaning/ memory etc. What you have one the armoire will also look great on that shelf. Might show great against the wall color.   I like your taste. User 10: Lighting in the soffit, could be pots that shine down or a strip the shines up off the ceiling. OP: Thank you! I really like your idea of adding lights on the soffit! I will try this! User 11: Cool unisex vibe, imho. Feels kind of upscale hotel, where anyone could come in and sleep there happily. Maybe adding to your bedding with some of that gorgeous green would tip it over into more masc without costing a fortune? User 12: Wall art User 13: I think it looks great. User 14: Throw a massive party OP: Brilliant idea! I will invite all Reddit users! User 15: Looks clean man, well done. What about something cool up the top on the shelf above the bed. Sorry I have no actual idea what would work there but maybe even a patterned wallpaper? I dunno, probably talking out of my arse OP: No no, those are excellent ideas you have! Thank you! User 16: You COULD invite me over. User 17: Wow this is a great space. Honestly you don't need to change much- you've done a great job with colour coordination and choice. Way more mature than many of the other places I've seen here that just look a bit too much like Patrick Bateman's apartment.  I agree with the others that some personal items would be nice though- perhaps some small family/friends photos above each nightstand? User 18: Bed skirt and maybe a plant or two User 19: I’d change the bed frame for a more masculine looking one, something more square and made of wood, and some artwork above it. Other than that it’s perfect! User 20: Yeah the bed frame has to go in my opinion. User 21: Looks great!  Art work above bed, maybe a mirror, plants.  I think it lacks a focal point, which is why this beautiful room feels a bit incomplete.    Do you have room for an old chair?  Every room is better with one! User 22: Can you do my room next? How would this improve your space? Well....we won't find out till we try, right?   More seriously, fantastic job! You have a keen eye. Some wall art would be a nice touch User 23: It already looks nice, albeit a tad bit feminine, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but it could use a jolt of masculinity. 3 things I would personally consider changing — 1. Fringe rug 2. Bedding 3. Bed frame  Those are just my 2 cents. It does look nice as is though 🤙🏼 OP: Thank you for your suggestions! User 24: I agree. Looks great. I like the bed frame, but if you are going for more masculine look you could get a picture frame, a mirror, or a piece of art that’s got an iron look to it that compliments the design of the headboard. If that’s your cup of tea then a few accent pieces can change vibe of the bed frame. User 25: Do something with the curtains/curtain rod. It looks a little exposed, like wires trailing behind a tv. You can get a cover for it or upgrade the rod itself to something a little more decorative.   I agree with the others about a little artwork and some plants. Room looks great, but I think these would make that much better. User 26: that is a killer guest room and wouldn't change a thing. It's very inviting, very clean, perfect for family members and friends to come stay and feel comfortable.   If this is your bedroom I still stand by the adjectives used but depending on your age and martial status could use some age appropriate personalization.   If married your wife has free range so maybe make your bedside table have something cool on it like a solar powered or steam powered miniature engine. (google them they always look cool and have many different designes) incase it in glass gives it a classier touch. They look amazing and you can use them to teach your kids how engine's work some day.   My father has alot of these and casually showcased throughout the hour where you wouldn't notice unless you were looking and then think \"damn that's cool\" and he taught me about engines using them because they really do work in was pretty fun. There is also a very large enthusiast group for the hobby so if you want to expand its there and people get really into it my dad made a full functioning miniature workshop with old school punch drills and everything factories had to use back in the day off the one engine. (he doesn't showcase that in the open but was fun when people are really interested to bring out. The hobby as a casual one or deeper it's just cool my book. It shows you know how things work can assemble and run them and these machines were so beautiful in the day. Casual Manly as F if you ask me.  If its just your place I would also add a wooden chair next to the dresser to pull back to it casually have an wood axe sit on it propt up and some leather work boots on the floor next to them with a flammel drapped across the back of the chair. but I guess that one would totally depend on the area you live. if you would never use the axe and don't even have a fire place then dont i believe manly decoratiom should be functional to a degree.

OP: Thank you so much! It's wool and it feels so nice to the touch! This is the rug on the producer website [URL]  Not sure who distributes it in your country but I hope you can find it! User 12: To be honest, I love this natural vibe so far! I would love to know where you got the wood stool/side table! OP: Thank you, I really appreciate it! The stool that I bought is from Zara home( it think it's teak but not sure) User 13: Everyone is suggesting pendants/chandeliers, but how tall are your ceilings? A semi-flush mount might be a better option for this space OP: My floor is 265cm high User 14: A [rice paper lantern]([URL] would look lovely in your space User 15: do you like tha metal round side pedestal table?

User 17: Pinterest User 18: Simple [globe pendant]([URL] or [saucer light]([URL] Modern and is not going to clash with changing aesthetics over time. I highly advise against any of those sculptural wood pendants previously mentioned… I bought a pendant like that for my living room and the quality of light was not good. It cast stripped shadows all over room and the light was harsh. Aim for diffused light. OP: Good to know, never thought about it. Thanks!\n",

Not sure what colors will work best. 24f :) Image: a green bralet hanging from a hanger. User 1: this is cute! corset tops are soooo trendy these days. love it.   i would wear it exactly how youve mentioned. here is specifically what i would wear: menswear style high waisted black pants, block heels or open strappy sandals (black), i would wear the blazer as a coat situation… this top deserves to be shown!   hair in a messy low bun or wavy messy hair. gold jewelry. simple makeup, red lips.   ive been seeing these cute jackets lately from dynamite clothing. [here is the link]([URL] might be cute for this if youre into this. OP: Yess I was definitely thinking gold accessories and red lip! Low bun would be cute too. I have some black heels with a gold toe strap that could work perfectly buut NYC winter so we’ll see.   Jacket is so cute! User 2: These are great suggestions. Especially that coat!! I would go with the gold accessories.. Perhaps adding some color like mustard yellow, burgundy, or maybe even brown for the pants?? You can’t go wrong with black though. 😊 OP: Burgundy pants could be fire User 1: agreed!! you dont see a lot of burgundy and that colour actually works well with this deeper green. you should post an outfit update if you can! would love to see how it turns out. User 3: I thought of red too but maybe too Christmassy ? Unless it’s a Christmas party in which case it would be ✨ User 1: agreed!! User 3: High wasted black wide leg pants maybe? With some gold or silver detailing, and wear a necklace with the same hue. Definitely accessories to elevate.  I like the blazer idea in the other comment as well. OP: Absolutely! User 4: I have something similar to this and I wore it with light blue high waisted mom jeans, white blazer, white heels and gold jewellery User 5: Hey I love the way you plan on styling this!  Can I ask where you bought it? OP: Absolutely! It’s from Rihanna’s savage x fenty line but currently sold out. I bought it second hand from someone on Mercari! User 6: Something RED. Really vibrant. User 7: I would wear this with tan wide leg pants, white or black chunky heels or boots (with the foot covered) and a tan blazer. You could add gold jewelry User 8: Ohh. That’s preciousss. If I had the body for it I’d go for wide leg/ palazzo high waisted pants and boots underneath, the slim looking kind. Nothing ruched. Both gold and or silver accesories will work fine. Even black for a more goth look. But that depends on the vibe you want. Pants could be white or ivory would look amaaazing. If You could show me options I’d gladly help you style it 💛\n",

User 2: For a nice, warm off white, I'd suggest [\"Shoelace\" by Behr]( [URL] User 3: The color is already great but you could change the furniture OP: Agreed! It's past time. Would love to see suggestions.    Thanks and Happy New Year! User 3: I would get a more boxy looking sectional in a rich jewel tone color or a light neutral. The couch is currently the same color as the wood which makes it too heavy looking.   The area rug should have a more modern look. IKEA has great rugs for a great price point. User 4: Pearl User 5: white roof, yellow walls. User 6: A nice wam cream. User 7: Benjamin Moore Decorators white. it's a perfect white with no blue or yellow tint. Benjamin Moore Aura Bavarian Alps is a warmer white and will compliment the wooden beams. User 8: Blue User 9: Stucko beige, match to a creammy color brick if its in the mix.

Thanks :3 Image: a man's jacket with buttons in a gray checked suit. User 1: I'd wear a cream silky blouse, black dress pants, and black pumps (patent if you have them). OP: Thanks! Would  flare trousers work (only a little flare)? And what about a turtleneck? How mich jewlery should I wear? User 1: I think both of those would probably be fine, although it depends on your proportions.  I'd keep jewelry simple and neutral, gold hoops and a chain necklace.  White would also work, to me cream looks a bit more sophisticated. But it also depends on how \"white\" the white is in the blazer which is hard to see in a small pic. OP: Okky thanks! I'm definitively petite x3 Alright I'll look for something with the same white tone :3 User 2: It's winter so i'd recommend a black boot instead. And a ribbed black crewneck top. OP: What about boots like these? [URL]     (hope you can see it)        I own boots that look very similar. User 2: Hmm maybe a bit too chunky and casual, i'd do something like this: [URL]  I also like how the geometry of the block heel and pointed toe work with the checks of the blazer.    [Steve madden point toe ankle booties]([URL] OP: Okay thank you! OP: Yeah right boots seem much smarter. I do have boots but I have to try them on with the rest. OP: Oh and why rather cream than white? Sorry I'm a noob at fashion ^^' User 3: I personally don't like the idea of cream. But that's the thing it's all subjective, there's no right or wrong... Mostly. OP: Yeah I think I'm just gonna go with the same white as the blazer is to make sure it matches :3 User 4: All black would look stylish and polished in my opinion. You can do flats, boots or oxfords instead of heels. Flats will give a kind of “academia” vibe, which is nice. OP: Yeah I think I'm gonna go with black for the rest of the outfit :) User 5: You can even wear a cream long sleeve shirt if a cream blouse it too much. Usually the color cream looks very luxurious in comparison to just white. And it’s a color that looks good on all skin tones. It would look more put together than all black unless you have a pretty black blouse. OP: Okky thank you! I dont know if a blouse would be too much because the blazer already looks special but I'll try one on tomorrow when I'm shopping \\^\\^ and I'll definitly look out for a cream long sleeve. User 5: You can even pair it with a grey long sleeve and black pants. You may like that too, if you end up not picking a blouse. That way it’s not too much of a reach going all out with fashion, and you’ll still feel comfortable. OP: It is for an apprenticeship as a clerk (i have no idea if it is translated correctly, sorry)  in a real estate agency. User 6: I always like a hint of red with houndstooth if not for an interview!  Good luck!!🍀 OP: Thank you! User 7: It seems to me that dark blue is often associated with looking professional. User 8: I think a black turtleneck would look sharp. I second the cream-coloured blouse suggestion too OP: I like the black turtleneck idea too, especially because I alredy own one \\^\\^' User 8: And bonus: extra cozy! OP: Yes exactly! And it matches with the weather xb User 2: The blazer is a statement piece, so i'd tone down the rest with: Neutral tone slim fit top (heavier knit, cashmere-ish, mid or long sleeve), black straight leg pants, black ankle boot, and probably a small statement necklace.   Ultimately you want something you can move around & feel comfortable in. OP: Thank you. I've got some black dress pants already so I'll probably wear them. And Ive also got some black boots. Only have to find a good top and some nice new jewelry :3 OP: What about boots like these? [[URL] (hope you can see it)  I own boots that look very similar. User 9: I don’t think those particular style boots would be appropriate. I would say a heeled boot/bootie. OP: Okky I'll look into that thanks! User 9: I think a cream, white, black or even a rich dark red top would be fine (being professional does not mean only black and or white colors).   Black pants  Pumps or boots with some heels. OP: Okky. I don't know if I'm comfortable enough to wear colour. But I'll take the blazer shopping tomorrow and we'll see ;) Thank you! User 9: I think a silky creamy blouse would be very beautiful with a subtle gold necked and earrings.  Avoid bracelets as people jiggle them or move them around when nervous in interviews and it’s distracting. OP: Alright thank you! I'll definitely look out for that :) OP: And I guess I have to leave my rings at home xb User 9: If you are a ring fiddler , yes leave them be. User 10: Cream or soft warm coloured blouse, black skirt and tights, black shoes. User 11: Jewel tone blouse, slim black pants, shoes to match blouse. User 2: I love the idea of jewel tone blouse, but at that point the outfit might be wearing her depending on her skin tone User 6: Black turtle 🐢 and a red lip User 2: Red lip screams \"date\" not \"work\". User 5: You can def wear a red lip to work. I maybe will keep the lip colors soft for an interview though. User 12: I've never heard this before lol OP: I don't know if I'm confident enough to wear red lip stick xD User 13: Black sheer pantyhouse, wool mini skirt, chunky sole loafers and a thin turtleneck sweater OP: I really like that idea but I think I would be too insecure to wear that to an interview. Maybe once I work there xD also I dont own any skirts that would fit or chunky sole loafers.

User 1: Hmmm, you will probably find this too simple but my first thought was a simple paper light - one of those lamp shades made from white paper. The room looks so nice and calm, I wouldn't want the lamp to be distracting. OP: I’ve posted on here before, but still stuck. I tried to get help from the Havenly design consult but still not sure. One suggestion was [this]([URL]  light from World Market for more texture, but also thinking of [this]([URL] light. It comes in brass but also black...   Any ideas? My ceiling is only 9’ high so not a ton of room for a big chandelier or anything like that. And I’m trying for something more than a simple drum light   EDIT: Wow thank you all so much for the suggestions. Definitely some great ideas. I have another bedroom to do and will definitely refer back for ideas.... I ended up going with my option #2. Can’t wait for it to arrive! User 2: I do like those, but if your room gets warm at all in the summer, you'll appreciate a ceiling fan immensely.  They're also useful in the winter for pushing the warm air back down where you can feel it. User 3: I second the ceiling fan. I can’t live without one. User 4: I have a ceiling fan with a large filament bulb instead of a shade on the light and I couldn’t live without it. User 5: I LOVE the beaded chandelier! I have been eyeing it myself. User 6: I actually like it as well! It almost looks like one of those firm cushions/ottomans, with the braided cable... I have no clue what they would be called, but do you know what I mean?! User 5: Yes! Love those. Tufted ottoman. User 7: I quite like that second light you linked. User 8: I like the second one you linked a little better, but both of those would work. I would check out Shades of Light. They are pricey but have some cool stuff:  [URL]  Edit: I just tried to pick a random example but this one is a little ugly lol 😂 User 9: Of all the options suggested, I like the two you've already chosen!  And good on you for being willing to take a risk, design-wise, with your lighting! That beaded semi-flush mount light is pretty cool. My only concern is that it could limit your design choices in the future. If you want to change up the look of the room anytime later on, you'll likely need to change out that fixture again, whereas the second option is more \"classic\" and will go with more looks. User 10: I know this isn’t helpful for your specific request, but don’t be afraid of design..  Why a flush mount?!?? Doesn’t world market make that beaded version in a gorgeous, like amazingly draped chandelier?!?!?  I mean, you could put a bright coral number in there. You’ve got gray and white. User 7: If you want something that would remain fairly unobtrusive but still be unique, I think something like [this]([URL] would be wonderful. User 11: I like these for your room.[ 1.]([URL]  [2.]([URL] User 12: Ooohhh OP go with the capiz light linked above (#2) it’s so soft and glam and lovely User 6: Yes! #2 User 13: Cant See #2 due to not being in the US. Do you have another link? User 11: It's a capiz shell, flush mount light. I'm sure it will come up with a search. If you are in the uk here is a[ link to one similar.]([URL] User 13: Oh, Nice! Thanks a lot! :) User 14: I'd do a small crystal chandelier. User 6: Great idea! A touch of sparkle. User 15: West Elm has a ton of geometric flush mounts like this  [[URL]  that I think would look good in this room User 16: I’d put a ceiling fan that resembles bamboo leaves. Edit: One more thing to suggest.  Consider another curtain to even out both sides of the window. OP: Thanks! Ordering another curtain... wasn’t expecting only 1 to come! User 17: I think [this lamp]([URL]) would be absolutely stunning. And I think the space could handle it because the design is already leaning slightly masculine, so I don’t think the femininity of this lamp would be overpowering.   If that’s a little too ostentatious, I think [this lamp]([URL] would also be beautiful.  Edit: [This one ]([URL] is also great. User 18: That is a very nice Ikea light. User 18: I came here to suggest a large barrel light, so I'm no help at all. User 19: I do the same thing with a power strip next to my bed. Respek!

User 24: [This one]([URL] might look pretty cool if you have any blue tones already in the room. I can’t really tell if those are grays or navys since your pic is kinda dark. Either way, look through Serena & Lily’s other lighting options too. I have one of their capiz pendants in my dining room & it’s beautiful. User 25: I'm a Floridian, a fan is necessary around these parts. I still think there's opportunity for [style.]([URL]  This [one]([URL] is a little more flushed against the ceiling.  I'm thinking anything in a silver tone is going to work. User 26: Hi would you mind linking me to where you got the rug from?  It would be perfect for my room lol OP: It’s a Safavieh wool dip dye I originally got from wayfair but I found it [here]([URL] User 27: Go with something flush in a bronze or black tone  [Check out the photos posted in reviews for this particular fixture]([URL]  The light coming out will put patterns on the ceiling...which will give it light texture  I know its tempting to put in a light that hangs down, but to be honest, I never liked that look over a bed.    Its also worth noting you have a visible burn in on the ceiling (circle of less faded paint)  The fixture I suggested is 15\" wide...and that may be enough to cover that spot  If you go with a chandelier style fixture, you will only get a small junction box cover...and that burn in will always be visible  As for finishes...Bronze and black are timeless.  Where as nickel tones and chromes come in and out of fashion.  If you are spending good money on a light fixture, go with something that will work with all kinds of decor options so you don't end up having to replace it again in a few years should you change up the style of the room OP: Thanks for your detailed reply! The circle on the ceiling is from the people before me painting around the flush mount that was there... planning to repaint! User 7: I’ve had that same “fixture”!  Your room looks great, and has traditional elements, maybe something that is a lovely contrast to that vibe? User 28: [URL] User 29: Do LED strips around the walls at the top.

I wear light cotton or other natural fabric pants (denim does not breathe and gets heavy if wet, a cotton tee with a long sleeve shirt or cardigan in case the flight is cold, maybe a scarf to ward off chill from air vents, and socks and closed toes shoes,or athletic shoes. Open toed shoes or sandals are not good if there is an emergency situation with broken glass,plastic or fire. You can still look good when traveling,but please dress for safety too. Have a great flight!

Thoughts? Image: a picture of the inside of an apartment that was recently renovated. User 1: Paint aside, can I just say how dreamy this apartment is?? Love the stairs. User 2: I love this place too!! Perfect for one person or even a couple. My cat would love the railings and stairs. I'm a little jealous lol. User 3: I think the color white is fine. I’m concerned that he’s painting a rental in a flat finish. That’s gonna be so hard to clean User 4: This. Use matte, flat will be a disaster just leaning up against it with a button on a jacket or even the little metal snaps on jeans. Scratches and marks everywhere. User 5: Omg they painted either flat white or just primer on our walls and its the absolute worst. I might have to invest in a 5 gallon bucket of matte washable type paint. I have a kid and a husband who both like to touch walls and leave fingerprints! User 6: I would steer clear of flat. User 7: Hard to clean but also super easy to roll-over again for touch-ups. User 8: Yup, this. I wouldn't want white, but that's what the brother wants so whatever. The real issue I see is with the flat. It's not washable at all. Definitely gloss it up a notch or two. User 9: It will have to be painted after every tenant. I do not understand why people put flat white on walls. Ceilings—absolutely. Walls—why? User 10: I personally like the white, having the ceilings and walls the same colour means that the sloping bits are not emphasised. Any way, I would always let the person who lives there have the choice... and he wants white! User 11: If the guy living there wants it white then there's no reason to spend time & money making it not white. It doesn't make any sense. He can always paint it later if he changes his mind. User 12: You are still allowed to change your mind after considering other peoples ideas/opinions...sometimes people (myself included) think they know what they want because they simply don't have an eye for the bigger picture until someone points out a great idea. Also i do agree with the father, that place could use a little bit contrast with that amount of space on the walls. If he truly doesn't want to consider another option he should be allowed to stick to his own vision, but i don't understand why you gotta make this about \"trying to talk someone out of their choice\" (especially with your second comment here). User 11: Because it's pretty common for people to be so focused on what they feel is technically correct that they don't notice a conflict brewing because the other person is having their point of view being stepped on when it's actually the more important one. Relationships are more important than paint. OP asked for advice and that's my advice. User 12: OP asked for thoughts on white or white with grey contrasts. He didn't ask for family therapy. User 13: Well my opinion on white vs grey is that the person living there wants white therefore it should be white  And in any case the room has plenty of wood to offset the clinical look white can give without contrast User 11: Too bad, once you post on reddit you are blood oath bound to take whatever advice you get even if it's just perhaps consider respecting your brothers opinions! OP: We do have to paint the walls another coat either way, and we already have the grey paint from a project in the main house.  You’re point is well taken but my dads argument is that the only time difference will be cutting in, as we have to roll it either way User 11: Still I would be pretty upset if my dad and brother made a decision like this knowingly going against my wishes, or tried to talk me out of my choice to the extent that they thought Reddit's opinion mattered more than my own about my own home (and it is his home as long as he's staying there) User 14: You may need to do more than one coat btw. User 15: If he wants white he should paint it white. There are so many shades of white to pick from. He can get a cool one which will lean slightly more gray and look that way under certain lights or go with a warm white (my preference) which will not feel sterile, especially with the wood tones. User 16: I think with the sloped walls, white is best for this space. Flat white on the walls and glossy white on the trim. Plus that’s what he wants? It’s clean and modern, go for it. User 17: Pick Sherwin Williams City Loft. It's off white, but sooo pretty and cozy. Not sterile looking, but still very white. Depending on the lighting and time of day it gets slightly pink, beige, grey tones. I seriously love it. I did my whole house in it! (Also, I am tired of the everything-must-be-grey trend). User 11: This space has a lot of angles.  Painting the ceiling white and walls a color will create too much visual busyness.  It's the opposite of what you want to do.  It's best to paint the ceiling ***a*** white and the walls a couple whites down on the color strip...your eye won't see it as two different colors but more shadows and light. User 18: I'd go with white but not flat. Those seem like high traffic areas, so maybe a satin or eggshell for ease of cleaning.   Light gray is blah/off-trend. Pick a different color, paint some accent walls? But as long as you're also going to put up photos, art, house plants, white is the perfect backdrop. User 19: Depends on his style. It’s his place. If he wants white then make it white.  As someone who like a more modern style, while I appreciate what Grey would look like. I’d go for white myself. User 20: I would prefer white, I think grey is on its way out.  If your dad owns the apartment though then dad wins. :) User 21: A few questions:  1. Is painting a rental really an option?  2. Is it currently not flat white?   Like the other comment says, there's no point making it not white if that's what your brother wants. However, your dad is right, a nice light grey would look better. User 22: I'm personally leaning towards gray, I agree with another commenter that white would be very sterile, and if this is a rental that won't be for family in the future, it'll help hide scuffs or scratches better than white walls would imo.   If he likes art, I also think the gray will help the art on the walls stand out a bit more, depending on how they're matted/framed. My mind is making that curvy staircase wall a gallery wall and I'm drooling over it lol User 23: It should be up to the person that is living there. User 14: White looks right right to me - it makes the structure the focus, rather than a wall color. There’s already the floor, the staircase, the eaves got contrast.   Light grey is starting to feel very dated, in my opinion, and may make that space feel a little dirty since it doesn’t have the ‘clean’ feel of 90 degree angles.  And skip the accent wall - that’s for big box rooms, not this beautiful space.   Oh and flat is fine for rentals - yes it holds dirt/smudges easier, but there is also no finish to show up when you touch up just spots. I have 2 rentals with flat and it’s fine. User 7: Gray has been done to death. White is timeless and fresh. User 24: It depends on what the decor will be User 25: I love white walls.  You can always accent w/ hangings.  But, have him look into how wall color affects perception of size, and visit something like /r/malelivingspace (or somewhere he can get decorating ideas) just so he has some idea of possibilities.  Agree w/ others on the flat white though -- it doesn't clean well.  Perhaps you could do some basic photo editing to visualize the gray (or other colors). User 26: Paint it white, specifically PPG Soft White. Just enough warmth to not feel stark and too bright. Sincerely, Leanne Ford. User 27: Flat white! I know painters hate it but you can always touch it up easily. Also when you are staring at a blank space it's easy to want some contrast. But the room doesn't end with the paint. Where the contrast should come in is with the furnishings, rugs and art. Think about an art gallery, tones of contrast because the walls take a backseat to the pieces that matter! You have to imagine all aspects of a room before they physically come together. User 28: I have a similar space, and advise going with the grey.   I had originally painted everything an off-white, creamy ‘bamboo’ color. The arrangement of light and shadows made some of the features nearer the ceiling (a bulkhead, etc.), look stark, washed-out, and at times reflected so much light there was actually unpleasant glare.   I repainted the upper reaches two additional times, with increasingly darker tints. Surprisingly, what worked best could be described as ‘buckskin,’ significantly darker than the lower wall.   Despite the sharp contrast in color, the difference is only slightly conspicuous at mid-day. In bright daylight, though, the color difference is not at all noticeable. At anytime, no one would notice the difference but me, but using a darker color up above makes the space considerable more comfortable and cohesive. User 11: I think the white looks great, if you have the grey paint then I would use it very selectively to help break up the spaces - the wall by the kitchen and the one by what looks like a bar. User 29: I think you can get a Scrubable paint now in a FLAT that will be a bit more manageable. Sherwin Williams makes it I believe.   I personally love white walls with dark trim if you're going to stain anything. Also, having just painted my bathroom back to white, if you're bad at painting, you can hide how bad you are User 30: Flat white is a bad idea. The color white is ok, it's the flat that will give you trouble in its maintenance. User 31: Go with the light gray. That much white would make the place too sterile. User 32: Light grey is always a better option than flat white. User 33: Off white walls are better if you want a bit of contrast for white skirting/doors. I’d go for grey. User 34: I'd agree with the Dad (personally) as it grey will definitely open up the space and help with a \"clean\" look esp in the kitchen where some gloss or semi-gloss will avoid things looking dirty. Beautiful space. User 35: Making the staircase walls a darker color and rest white Wud work well. But I Wud make it darker than grey User 11: Grey definitely User 36: My lounge has three ash white and one very light grey wall and I must say it looks fantastic! It’s we have a slighter darker grey sofa in front of the light grey wall and the subtle difference makes a major different aesthetically.\n",
            "User 39 - bhw39r Original Post: Help me pick out curtains, please! What color would work best? i was thinking a white/purple ombré. Image: a living room with a lot of furniture and windows. User 1: I have no ideas, but I just wanna say that I absolutely LOVE everything about this! Especially the couch! OP: thank you so much! the couch is my favorite too! it’s from Floyd Detroit :) User 2: I think if you stick with white curtains or white with very light touches of color like embroidery you will be good. You have a lot of color already and white would allow the focus to stay on those items. If you did the ombré make sure it is subtle. OP: good point! thank you User 3: I just wanted to say that I love your design aestetic. Such bold colors but it doesn't  look like a crayon box. Cozy and sophisticated and gorgeous. OP: thank you so much! User 4: Do you want fabric curtains?   Idk why, but I would go with wood blinds! The ones with bigger pieces. I just think would go well with your aesthetic. OP: i do want fabric curtains. wood blinds would be nice! but sadly, changing the blinds is against the rules here :/ User 5: Depending on what you plan to do above the sofa, I think white curtains would be really nice.  But if you want colour, instead of ombré, have you considered doubling ups on the panels so you have a coloured panel on the very end and a white panel in the centre? OP: i didn’t think of doubling up, but that sounds lovely, thank you User 6: I love the colours you’ve got going on in this room and the textures are so nice! I’d say maybe consider a patterned curtain as most of your pieces are solid colours and it might add a little variety for the eyes. OP: thank you! yes i think a subtle pattern would be nice to break it up a little :) OP:  [some details ]([URL] User 7: I would pick art for above the couch before you choose curtains. User 8: I think you have good instincts. You could also do a blue/purple or yellow/purple ombre. I personally would do yellow and purple, but that's just because they're my favorite colors lol. OP: thank you, & ahh yes! i didn’t think of those combinations, i think they would work well! gotta do some research. User 8: Best of luck! I love what you've done so far btw. These colors all work really well together so it's nice and colorful without looking messy. Yellow is a very complimentary color, especially when paired with darker colors like these, so that couch is perfect, in my opinion. OP: thank you so much! the couch is my favorite spot in the house. at first i was afraid of the boldness of all the colors together, but i went ahead and did it and i’m happy with my decision. it really boosts my mood when i walk in the door. User 9: I would move the curtain brackets higher and farther apart to make the room look bigger. The white ombre is probably a good idea. Anything too bold and solid takes away from your furni. User 10: I'd go for a lighter grey. Or if you want ombre, a white to grey ombre. I would keep the curtains simple so it doesn't pull attention away from the lovely furniture, which imo should be the focus of the room. I would avoid patterns on the curtains for that reason, too.   Alternately, if you want the curtains to be more of a focal point, I'd go with dark blue so that it ties into the rest of the room rather than competing with it. User 11: At first I was surprised at your color choices, but after looking at all your photos, I'm really liking it.  Since everything is a solid color, and even the pillows are subtle prints, you might consider a pattern for your curtains.  I think an Ikat print would go well with your style. I chose this one because, although the pattern is bold, the intensity of the colors are soft.   [[URL] OP: thank you, i like this pattern a lot! User 12: I looooooove your mix of furniture! For curtains I'd go with a bold, organic pattern that incorporates the colour of your sofa OP: thank you! User 13: Your space is lovely! OP: thank you! User 14: Do you have a picture of the room facing the window? So we can get an idea of the larger scope. As I see it now I would go with a light curtain but with a small pattern in a color either purple or yellow. I got these at bed bath and beyond and they’re my favorite thing in my house right now    [URL]  Something like this would be nice too. In your colors, of course   [URL] OP: these are nice! thank you. [here]([URL] are some different angles of the room User 15: How do you like the floyd sofa? I want it but it’s so pricey 👀 OP: i absolutely love it. i live in Detroit so i was able to go to the store and sit on it after i did a lot of research on it, and i fell in love. it is a bit pricey but the quality is great! it’s a very sturdy piece of furniture, it’s super cozy. & i plan on keeping it indefinitely so i think it’s worth the price! plus it’s american made 👌🏽 User 16: Is that COUCH from Weston’s? OP: the couch is from Floyd Detroit User 17: wow, this is incredible, and I think white-purple ombre would look fantastic. follow your instincts! and please share progress pics :) OP: thank you! will do! :) User 18: Honestly, more often than not, ombré fabric can look really dated and juvenile.   If I were decorating this space, I’d go with a traditional print, like a floral, done in, or highlighted with, untraditional colors, so all the beautiful colors aren’t just sitting in the bottom half of your room :) OP: Ah, i see what you mean, i didn’t think of that. thank you! User 19: I love the colour you’ve got going on right now. For the curtains, I would suggest a green or a margenta colour.\n",

Image: a picture of someones feet with dark sneakers. User 1: Yes the white socks look bad. Wear darker socks. The shoes on the right look better. OP: Black shoes, roll up pants OP: There any set way to roll pants up? Any other time I've tried it looked tacky User 2: I usually cuff them by putting my finger on the stitching and rolling up once or twice. OP: Okay, the bottoms are elastic and tighten inward though so idk if itll work. User 3: Yeah don't roll them up if they're elastic/joggers OP: You think they'd look bad if they're a bit baggy? They seem to be in style at my school and I think they look alright but User 3: It's all about creating your style bro, when I wear joggers I prefer a tighter fit that cuffs about 2 inches above my shoes for a more athletic/Euro fit. But as long as you wear something loose on top or a baggy hoodie to match the baggy in the joggers you should be fine 👌 User 2: Nah i thought they were just plain khakis. I bet you could pull them off pretty well without cuffing them User 4: Pants work best with the black shoes. I say black socks. If you don’t have ‘em then no show socks and rolled the hem of the pant. That’s a more summer time look anyway.   Hope this helps. User 2: The pants are ok id say black works best with them. And white socks dont quite work imo\n",

Image: a woman with nails and a purse holds it. User 1: Get a bag because you love it 😀 don't worry if it goes out of fashion, it will come back anyway User 2: It's very much a trendy bag but, in my opinion, it's one of the better designs from Balenciaga. In terms of longevity, I would be concerned about how the bottom corners might wear over time. User 3: OP I feel the same way! I really love how the Hourglass bag has a classic silhouette with a twist and want to get one, but I’m worried as well about the longevity of it. Balenciaga so far only has one true classic bag style (the City) and I’m not even sure how long the Demna era will even last... my plan right now is to keep an eye out for discounts and only buy if there’s a super amazing deal out there User 4: OP as long as you think you'll still love it in 5 years, go for it. Styles are bound to change, but if looking at this bag will make you happy, then don't let that hold you back! User 1: Yea possibly a trend bag but  I see them keeping this style for a few more years so it may become their signature bag as it is a classic handle look - you can't go wrong with a classic colour too OP: yeaaa black is so sleek and i like the shape of it regardless of it is trendy or not, just worried of it looking outdated User 5: If you love it buy it. Worst case scenario you only use it for 2 years and then it looks really dated... but in 8-10 years you can pull it back out and use it again! User 6: I’ve never seen this Burberry bag before but I actually feel like this could easily become an everyday staple bag. It’s a fairly minimal bag but I love the shape - it really sets it apart. It feels different but also like it goes with a lot of things! Idk if I saw it in a vintage shop I would buy it. Just my 2 cents :)  Edit: wow just realized it’s Balenciaga not Burberry... their rebranding has done a number on me OP: yea i want to buy it for the style and not for the brand c: User 7: My mom and aunt had some trendy (back in the day) black leather bags that I'm using 20 years later and I thought it was so cool because nobody would have the same bag as me. (The shape of the bag was so cool and retro I loved it until it finally broke apart)  This actually inspired me to get an expensive leather bag for myself so I can pass it down to my future daughter. Maybe you could get it, love it and the pass it down too! User 2: >My mom and aunt had some trendy (back in the day) black leather bags that I'm using 20 years later and I thought it was so cool because nobody would have the same bag as me.

You want to be able to comfortably view it at eye level. For an accent chair, I would do a camel leather to accent the green. You need a blanket to cozy up your couch as well so for pillows and blankets I would bring in colors from your art work. Some solid color burnt orange and mustard yellow pillows on the sofa and then a dark green( to match the couch) or royal blue pillow on the chair.

Btw for your art:  It should be 6 inches above the couch and about 3 inches apart at most. You only want it to span the length of the sofa unless you plan on having an end table OP: We do plan to get an end table! Just moved in a couple months ago and starting from scratch. :) User 2: What a beautiful and thorough post. Amazing! User 3: FYI, the bottom of your artwork should be 6- 8 inches above the back of your couch. And a variety of sizes and shapes of primary colors would be great for pillows. User 4: Agree, lower the artwork OP: Oh it's too high you think? User 5: Yes, the general rule of thumb is about 8-10 inches above the couch so it’s more cohesive and visually connects with the furniture. OP: Thank you!!! I will adjust them -- I had no idea. My thinking was to make them roughly equidistant between couch and ceiling to fill up the wall and not make the top of the wall look empty but that makes total sense! User 6: I think some mustard yellow would go well in the mix, to compliment the artwork and it’s a very popular color. User 7: Second mustard! User 8: Agreed! User 9: Came here to comment mustard yellow as well. Some deep maroonish/purples would also pair beautifully! User 10: Either match it with more jewel tones (rich purples, blues, yellows, reds) or as others have said, something pale/a little bit “plainer”. User 4: Camel or tan leather for arm chair   I think white and black animal print  pillows with some solid colour pillows (colours from your artwork) would look great!

Image: the dining room table has four chairs and an arched window. User 1: That window is gorgeous. No advice sorry. User 2: I only suggest whatever you choose extends the full length of the wall so curtains can be pushed to the sides letting the full beauty of this window shine regularly.  Perhaps ceiling-mounted curtain tracks. User 3: I agree with those who’ve suggested a full iron rod across just under the crown molding.  Here’s a helpful article by Emily Henderson (former Hollywood set assistant and author of ‘Styled’):   [URL] User 4: I would frame the entire wall with curtains so none of the actual window is covered. I would do a black rod (or bronze), with curtain rings. White curtains will look nice here (IKEA ritva curtains are great, budget friendly and come in several lengths). You’ll want to hem them so they just barely skim the ground User 5: Either all the way to just under the molding and  from wall to wall.  Or an arced rod fitting in the window casing. User 6: Use a track system that attaches to the ceiling.  [URL] User 7: To add to this-- I would go all the way across from the left wall to the right.

Curtains, rugs, trash can, and behind the sink in corner are what I’m struggling with currently. Image: a room with a refrigerator, a dishwasher, a window and a trash can. User 1: Instead of a curtain for the wall window, I'd replace the blinds with larger faux wood blinds, [e.g. these]([URL] We installed something like these throughout our house, and it made such a difference!   This will give you lots of light, privacy when you need it, and no curtains in the way of your cooking. No blind cords hanging down either with this model. They are more substantial looking than the current blinds and will give the kitchen a finished look.   You could use them on the door too or use a curtain there if you prefer. User 1: Replacing all 3 blinds in this room would look tidy and cohesive though User 2: My suggestions are 1. buy a rolling island with butcher block on top and storage underneath. IKEA has a lot of styles & when I had a tiny kitchen I loved having extra prep space & I kept my two trash cans underneath (made chopped veggie clean up quick)  2. I like the idea of moving the key holder to the wall (where the rolling butcher block would be too).  3. It looks like you have plants...I think a couple of shelves on the wall where the keys are now would be great for more plants and more storage. They could even go all the way across if you need/want something in front of the window(I hope that part makes sense). OP: Yes love these ideas! I just got rid of my butcher block bar cart because it was a little big for that space. The vent is in a weird place and we can’t cover that up. Will for sure do trash cans on that wall though and probably move the keys. User 1: A stainless steel narrow trash could be pushed up along the long wall. User 3: If you want to inject some color, try changing the splash back to something really vibrant. Then you have a bit of zing without being too overwhelming. OP: It’s brand new construction (wasn’t my first choice but came with the house) and it’ll be a rental eventually so we won’t change that. Still love the idea of injecting color! User 4: There is also temporary back splash that is similar to temporary wall paper that is really easy to remove and doesn’t damage any of the tile and SUPER easy to apply!  edited for: grammar User 5: Not OP but I will be saving this idea for my future rentals to spice up the kitchen! No idea this existed, thanks!! User 6: I put [these stick-and-peel tiles]([URL] up in my kitchen and they are the best. Cheap, easy, and rental friendly/. User 5: Those are awesome- thanks! And perfect timing as I’m moving next weekend User 3: Plus, if you hate the color later on it's just a matter of changing a splashback/blind/decorations User 1: I'd move the key holder to the adjacent wall to give you more open space around the counter. OP: I had some hooks I was going to put there to hang out jackets and aprons! But I think we can fit both! User 1: If you're worried the kitchen looks small, you might put the jackets elsewhere, but the aprons hanging up will be cute! User 7: I agree with no jackets and moving the key holder. Maybe even hang the apron on the side of the fridge? User 1: I like this idea! OP: Yes! Love this User 8: You seem to already have an ideal image of the perfect space for you in mind.   If you really want to increase the “joy factor” you should decorate a space with photos of the people in your home, the frequent visitors, and those whom you love most: family and friends. This will inspire you to cook with care. The area in the corner is perfect if you make use of the vertical space.   Speaking of vertical space, another suggestion I’d make is to store as many things in the cupboards until they’re full to bursting—keeping as much as you can off the counters and floors. That will really lighten the air in your space once you add lightly colored curtains and area rugs. *Make use of the vertical storage in your cupboards by adding wire racks, shelves and storage on the inside of the doors.*   So, a garbage can that’s small enough to tuck away is ideal for any kitchen, and it keeps your trash from rotting over many days too.   -CC OP: Took this advice yesterday and jammed our cupboards! We hate stuff on the counters so if we can avoid it that’s what we prefer. We are the first ones living it after it’s been “flipped” so we were going to keep the floors, backsplash, counters, those are all new.   Love the idea of adding family photos! User 9: I wouldn’t bother with curtains.  But I would say roller blinds over Venetian blinds.  Venetian blinds are dust traps and drive me insane trying to keep them clean  You can get window film, a bit of a twist in a frosted style.  Could be good on the door and the window to the left if privacy is needed.  It’ll let light in.  Floating corner shelving above the sink rather than having everything piled up behind the sink, it will help with reducing the cluttered feel. You could get some nice containers to keep things in to help with storage  Can you get a half moon trash can in the US? They’re available in the uk, a good space saving idea because they push up against the wall  For the rug, maybe a ragrug, something colourful to bring the space to life you can take it with you when you let the place out User 10: I like rag rugs but they’re a trip hazard and a debris trap in a kitchen. User 11: Yeah I came here to say this... speaking as someone who’s seen first hand the result of someone tripping while carrying a pan of boiling water I can confidently state that trip hazards in the kitchen are a bad plan.  Please, don’t do it - a pretty kitchen is not worth melting your skin off half your body OP: Oh goodness thank you for the feedback! Any suggestions on rugs? User 11: My advice would be don't use a rug at all, honestly. I'd rather have a less-pretty, but safe, kitchen than a pretty one that could hurt someone  If you must, then a thin, heavy rug with bound edges and a grippy (eg rubber) underside would be best, to minimise risk of it bunching up or folding over  But really, why take the risk at all? Even if the risk is low, it's higher than without a rug OP: Floating shelves sound amazing! I see the have corner shelve should can install but open to more ideas for this! User 12: Floating shelves for the right corner for plants. I dont have any recommendations for rugs, though. I thought maybe a large round rug but I'm not sure how it would look. User 10: Trash bin under the sink or another lower cabinet, wood cordless blinds  (no curtains), 3 or 4 tier corner shelving behind the sink affixed to the wall (adds storage) and starting right above the backsplash, and rug is completely optional but probably not something I’d consider in this space. You could use a couple colorful foam standing mats in front of the sink and stovetop, though. User 13: I would paint the walls minus the crown molding (keep that white) the same greyish brown as the tile at sink. Do white corner shelving above . So for window near sink, white wooden plantation shutters. Window on door-dark blue tint (silver facing outside) application. Window along wall- large oversized white wood curtain rod white linen curtains. Now optional - wall between door & window long vertical floor to ceiling short 7*shelves. Good for spices, canned goods, wine. Don’t know what to do with trash can yet. Get back to you maybe🤗 User 14: Hanging plant on one of the top corners of the window frame in like a terracotta planter adds a splash of colour and life to the windows - it’s very washed out atm. I agree on some beech or mahogany style wood blinds, some decorative items like a recipe book stand, utensil pot and other things in a colour theme might pop this corner out a bit more. User 15: I have plants behind my corner sink, they make me happy. User 16: At first glance the thing I straight away though was that you had little bench space and agree that you should purchase a stand alone butchers block table that you can wheel away to the side when not in use. User 17: Slim island on casters on the blank wall.  I second checking out IKEA.  Stainless steel trash can with foot pedal lid.  Wood blinds.  And a couple of these:  [URL] User 18: For the kitchen rug, I’d do a long runner style one either leading in from the door with a mat in front of the sink, or keep a mat in front of the door and put the runner in front of the dishwasher/sink area. Something like this:   Kapaqua Custom Size Grey Turkish Kilim Rubber Backed Non-Slip Hallway Stair Runner Rug [URL]\n",

I would get a bust of Athena. User 2: A bust of Athena's bust User 3: Big plant User 4: Peace Lily, Monstera, Fiddle Leaf Fig  *unless you have a cat, all have levels of toxicity. User 5: Obviously a pole for tiny dancers. User 6: You have some options too, could do a tiny pole for fairy strippers, or a bit bigger for santa's elfs in the off season or go bigger and just say its for midgets. OP: (Relatively) just moved into a new place with this pedestal-type thing in the corner.  Lots of changes to make, but this is one I’m stuck on.  Feel like it could be a decent opportunity, but having a hard time thinking of how best to utilise it, other than just putting a plant on it, as I have been until now.  It’s probably 3 feet high, so about waist-height for me at 6‘3.  EDIT: The corner in particular gets LOTS of light from morning to mid afternoon, so bar isn’t really possibility, after seeing a lot of suggestions. Photo was taken late in the afternoon after light had died down a lot. User 7: A 3 foot tall bust of your own head.   Similar to the pro football hall of fame. User 8: Plants, plants, plants!! Yay plants!   I kinda like the idea of putting some plants there OP: Thinking more plants might be the way to go with the space there, rather than just the one Kentia User 9: Get a large sculpture to go there. User 10: Sculpture and plants. That’s the move User 11: Marble statuette. Gotta be. User 12: A few books and a plant, maybe a light and make it like a “reading nook” User 13: A nice Monstera Deliciosa mate. User 14: Sculpture of your calves.. Gotta honor yourself User 15: Plant? User 16: Coffee bar. User 17: Cat basket. Trust me, I'm a cat. User 18: Bar User 19: Could do a cool vintage rotating table fan too User 20: Get a replica of the SuperLambBanana, and some fairy lights.   That is a great view of the city. User 21: If you drink, then a bar area. Have a few bottles/decanters, nice glasses, wine/glasses, but also - a small neon sign. That would look really cool against the window. Lots of people are saying plants, but won’t that block/take away some of your view? OP: Had thought about some kind of bar thing, but it gets LOTS of direct light in the morning, so maybe that’s a case for adding more plants and against the bar, thinking about it. Would block some of the view, though, yeah. User 22: My only concern with that would be the decanters in a ton of direct sunlight. As I understand thats kinda frowned upon for the booze. User 23: You could possibly even start a fire or burn the spot if light gets directed through the glass correctly. Happened with this decorative glass hexagon my mom had when she was a kid. User 24: Use some empty booze bottles with led lights...mix up with some photographs, a trailing plant or two, small bust of a philosopher or starwars or somesuch hero... DO NOT PUT serious art or booze at that spot as light and temperature fluctuations will, for sure, ruin it. User 25: The answer is plants User 26: A grand piano would be AWESOME!!! OP: Feel we might be over-estimating the amount of space I have to work with, here… User 26: Lmao that's right User 27: The Lego Colosseum. You get to spend 50 hours building it and show it off. User 28: you should put those plants on the floor up on that pedestal. plant will be happy because sunlight. you will be happy because plant User 29: Giant vase or statue of a person or wild abstract art that means something to you User 30: A plant bruv, or art. User 31: a plant is cool... or you can make it your corner bar. put some nice bottles up there and glasses so when ppl need a drink they naturally head over there. User 32: Plants or lamps my friend but it looks like you have a good overhead light there..maybe a display of some type User 33: ALL OF THE PLANTS!!!!   &#x200B;  FEED ME SEYMOUR User 34: Plants! User 35: Obviously question: what’s inside? Can you remove it? OP: Rented apartment, unfortunately, so not a possibility. Also seems to have some electronics inside, as there’s a power outlet on the side, just out of view. User 35: Mmh, I have read the other comments and plant/bar seems the best things you can do with it. My suggestion is to buy a lamp and make a little cozy corner User 36: Wine cellar. User 37: Eh, make the best of it. I could see getting a cool patterned tablecloth / blanket / scarf or something to drape over it and putting a plant or two up there. Maybe a small lamp? User 38: Minibar, photos, plants, decorations User 39: Get  beautiful black shelves and make it a mini bar User 40: A large marble statue. User 41: I reckon a small shelf on the side of it could work out as well. Itcould serve as a place to place books, your remote, more plants, drinks etc. User 42: What about shelves for some books?

            "User 49 - ex9001 Original Post: I would like suggestions for filling all the empty space on my living room wall. Image: the room has a tv and balloons in it. User 1: A bookcase/shelving unit? You can add plants, artwork, books, pics, anything that will help to bring personality! OP: Hmm, What area of the room are you thinking? There is a window to the right of that corner with the lamp.   Maybe there? Maybe if I angled it across the corner it would take up more space. What do you think?  Edit: hey they actually make some that fit in corners. I’ll keep an eye out! User 1: I was actually thinking to the left of the tv in this pic as it’s a little wider? To the right you could put a little low locker like those available from the company mustard, or a side table/console/sideboard you could put a record player on top if you’re into them.   I also like pic rail shelving to put actually on the wall itself. That way you can put up multiple frames of artwork/cards/posters/trinkets and swap them around regularly (or just whenever) and never have to drill any more holes. OP: The carpet has many of the tones present in my couch and  kitchen countertop and cabinets and the room has tile floor. I’m not a fan of the tile at all because it makes the place feel very sterile.  I’d like to cozy the place up, but it’s entirely too spacious and bare at the moment because it is connected to my kitchen leaving a large open area with large empty walls. User 2: Giant wall map of Earth, then low shelves on either side filled with your hobbies and some plants for air quality User 3: Add some stools at the counter, and a poster sized art work above the counter.   Fix your cords if you can so they're not showing.   Ditch the outdated torch floor lamp and replace it with a tall plant. Or you could do an accent chair there in the corner, moved in to the room so the front feet are on rug. You could then get a different floor lamp, one that points down not up.   Consider getting a longer console. Even though your t.v. is the right size for that console, a longer console will give you a surface to place table lamps and other decor including plants. Can also conceal the outlet. One that encloses the peripherals would be nice too for a more streamlined, less cluttered look.   Then do two big pieces of art to the right and left of the t.v. You could do smaller art above the t.v., or leave that area blank. User 4: Just adding an upholstered chair and end table in that corner would help a lot. User 4: Most expensive, time consuming, and turns out enviably: original artwork through Ebay and shopping locally.  I like modern art, so original stuff to my taste tends to be fairly affordable.  I filled a wall about this size over 2-3 years.  Most pieces cost me between $40 and $200, including shipping and framing.  But I still need to frame 3 and reframe 2, and the cost is a deterrent.    Can be a bit expensive, depending: a tapestry.  I bought an elaborate silk embroidered tablecloth in Mexico for $200, but didn't have any real use for it.  My mother sewed matelasse cloth tabs to one end and I hung it on a blank wall.    Saw it in a thrift shop, thought it was brilliant:  a large gallery-wrapped length of patterned upholstery fabric in a frame, around 4x6 feet. User 5: i used to have this bookshelf that i bought at walmart that looked like a leaning ladder. that’d be precious where the lamp currently is. you can find a smaller lamp for cheap to stick on the bookshelf itself to add light that way.   mount the tv if you can to bring more attention up the walls.   i’d put a floor-length mirror to the left of the tv (in the photo) User 6: Where’s your sofa and coffee table? The tv and tv bench are too small for the room which isn’t helping, and the lamp is too tall. User 7: Larger tv, floor standing speakers, subwoofer. That space is literally perfect for a mini home theater. Like... I’m jealous it’s so perfect.  Besides: hanging shelves, corner plant, art. User 1: Get rid of that pink thing . All done here boys pack it up and head out OP: Lol, the pink balloon is the focal point of the room bro! User 1: Lmao grfoh User 8: Can you move tv to right hand wall of photo? Then a sofa could face it. Big bookcase wall would fill this wall nicely. User 9: Mount the television. Where it is.  Above it, centered symmetrically, stretch or have stretched a painting that matches the perimeters of the walls around it but 2-3 ft shorter.....so I'm guessing something like an 5' x 11' painting.  Make it an enamel white with semi gloss.   Divide only the upper left corner of the painting Into simple geometric shapes that reflect/mimic the beautiful combination of colors you have on your floor.  Possibly paint table legs white and separate tv from it's stand, clean it up. Or substitute with a basic Ikea cube like stand. Or a series of them that weigh a little heavy to the left of your center point. Then to the right of stands a tall indoor green plant with clear or white vase.   Think Gustav Klimt metallic and taupe color combination, with a white background and elements. You're working with a great floor to anchor the color heirarchy you use.   Rid the balloons and work the lighting. It would be very clean. :)  IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIo User 10: 2 medium or 3 small pics, centred between the wall and the breakfast bench. And another longer entertainment unit. User 11: I had a large blank wall like this- I got a projector for about $70 on Amazon and I hung string lights on the wall around the projected screen. I made a pretty simple shelf to put the projector on the opposite wall above the couch. Get a snake plant or some succulents for the TV stand/projector shelf. It is soooo freaking cozy and people love coming over to play video games on the projector. User 12: What types of art do you like? If you had a bookcase could you fill it? Do you like any of [this]([URL] stuff? User 13: White-colored furniture. User 14: My living room set up  looked like this as well! My solution was to start by getting a taller/larger more buffet style mid century style entertainment center. Mounted the TV a couple of feet above it, and surrounded the TV with a mosaic gallery wall of artwork I've found or had given to me. I put a 3 ft tall snake plant on a stand on floor on the left side of the console. I have candles, photos and a few small plants on the console top. I think starting with a new TV stand is a good starting point!  Edit: words and things\n",

Essentially when we move in, it’s a complete blank canvas.   The living room and kitchen are joined and so I only really have the one wall to use. Not sure how to get the most out of the space! Would like more seats, if possible! User 2: In that case, base it off of the picture. Where they have the couch is ideal. You can put two chairs on the window bay and have a table between them and get a nice rug User 1: This is what I was going to suggest. Leave it open for a traffic path to enter the space. Sofa on long wall, coffee table in front of sofa, loveseat or 2 chairs in front of bay window, rug to tie it all together! OP: Can’t believe how quickly you guys have responded.

My wardrobe would go better with the black ones OP: Same, a lot of my clothes can match with the black ones but i can also find a way to make the white one fit too User 2: Personally, I think the cork looks summery and goes best with the white. The black is a bit of a disconnect for me.   They’re both nice styles though! User 3: If planning for spring, white User 4: equally nice.  If you wear a lot of black or prints with black go for black.  If you wear more light colors and floaty fabrics go for white. User 5: White definitely. Like another user said, cork is a summer material. I feel like black looks a little out of place with cork User 6: They’re both slightly out of season/style but I’d say the black unless you live in Miami or Palm Beach User 7: I agree. I feel like the white ones are a bit more dated than the black ones though. User 6: Agreed. Maybe the black style in white would be better than the cut out style of the white User 8: Look up crocs if you like the style of the black ones.

If you're worried about walking through, they make sink+vanity options that face sideways. maybe something like this?  [[URL] OP: I thought about that, but i was concerned how they react to water?

This might be impossible but here's an idea if you're looking to really renovate: put the shower where the toilet is, and bring the toilet out to sit next to the sink. It seems like your toilet is taking up a lot of room since it's at an angle.

Not sure if I phrased that right but anything from the ceiling seems like it would be garish as hell, while at least with the Hue lights you could change the brightness and color with your phone for whatever you need. User 2: Yeah or any sort of strip led lighting right under the rails. Or you could go fancy and do strips under the stair lips, would be more effort and more $ but worth User 3: I don’t think it would be that pricey to have an electrician install a switched light up on your ceiling. Permanent and looks better than LED strips. By code you should have a light for those stairs anyway. User 4: Where do you live,  that that staircase passes the building code? User 5: I'd go with these motion sensitive [LED Closet Lights] ([URL]   Just peel and stick them where you need them, no need for a wall outlet and are rechargeable via usb connection.

Leave enough space behind the couch (left side of the picture) to make a pathway to that doorway behind it.  It will make a smaller sitting and TV-viewing area, and place the couch closer to the tv. It might break up the room too much and block that exterior French door though. OP: Yeah, that was actually my initial idea, but trying to envision it, I think it would make the room shrink. That seemed like the best idea at first. User 5: One advantage would be that the walking path no longer passes between the tv and couch. It might make the room feel smaller, but it would create two distinct spaces; a tv-viewing space and a “hallway” behind the couch. I think a lot of people have a tendency to push all the furniture against the walls, which can make for awkward spacing. But yeah, sometimes, it’s the only option because the space is already too small. User 6: If the couch connection allows: put the tv on the wall where the couch is, then move the couch to be where the edge of the rug is. You’ll have a corridor to walk to the deck doors behind the couch and you’ll be a couple feet closer. If you wanna mount the tv, you can get an extending mount that you can move in and out while watching or not User 6: If both sides of the couch L are the same, you can just rotate it 90 degrees OP: This was my initial idea, but  do you think it would break up the room too much and make it feel a lot smaller? Was trying to envision it myself. User 6: How about having the L in the complete opposite position currently? Then you’ll have a wide open flow of space from the dining table to the couch area. The rug still sections off the area well User 7: pull the sofa a foot away from the wall User 8: Without replacing the couch, it seems to me it's going to be difficult. User 9: Personally I actually really like this set up.  If it wasn't for that doorway in the corner... I would've put the TV stand on an angle in that corner.  But the way it is isn't too bad.  You could probably get used to it. User 10: Put a console table behind the couch to move it more forward maybe something about 40cm wide   [URL] OP: That's actually a phenomenal idea\n",
            "User 58 - ho78i7 Original Post: What do I do with this dining space? Image: a dining room with an empty dining table and chairs. User 1: I think it's already gorgeous.  Choose simple, minimalistic additions, otherwise it will look cluttered. User 2: Yeah.  I think it looks awesome already!  Get rid of the small side table, and just own the minimalist 80's vibe.  I would add a very present yet simple chandelier or oversized pendant in the middle; maybe hung just a little too low.    You obviously have some taste.  own it! OP: Aw, thank you! I am totally ready to lean all the way into the 80s vibe. The just-too-low chandelier is such a cool idea. Thanks! OP: Thank you! You are so sweet! Good call on the minimalist approach -- with this tile floor, we need to avoid anything that might suggest clutter. User 3: i would do a low open shelving unit on the low divider wall to the left, something like [this]([URL] I'd keep to a walnut finish to match the darker tone of the chair legs.  id keep the mirror where you have it and put a half marble table below it and put some plants or decor there.  for the table i think something like a smaller live edge table would fit the space nicely and change the rug out to a more subdued [afghan]([URL] like so, i think itll accentuate with the walls beautifully. OP: Love these ideas! Thanks! User 4: If you're looking for more space, I'd swap the table for a [round table]([URL]  I like the mirror, but you could add [floating shelves]([URL] on both sides. With a round table, it give you more room to add a [buffet cabinet/console]([URL] under the mirror. I think some [pampas grass]([URL] in a beautiful vase in the right corner would compliment this room quite nicely. The floor seems to have a pattern of it's own, so I would probably stick to a neutral pattern or solid color [rug]([URL] that compliments the green/brown tones. OP: These are fantastic suggestions. Thank you! User 5: Add a long credenza under the mirror with a pair of lamps on either side of the mirror. Replace the recessed light with a chandelier that drops over the center of the table, something interesting that will be reflected in the mirror.   The rug needs to be bigger -- if you are sitting the chair legs are half on/half off the current rug. I like the suggestion of going with a quieter rug since the flooring is busy. You could also do no rug at all.   If they'll fit,  have the chairs side by side on the long sides of the table, rather than at the ends. Not sure they'll fit though-- it looks like the chair legs are competing with each other. If that is the case, you may want to swap out the table OR the chairs for different styles.   If you keep the chairs, you could add sheepskin throws to them to alleviate the green on green effect and also add some comfort as well as texture.   If you keep the table, you could paint it (at least the legs) a bold color. How about orange? OP: Thanks for these ideas! I hadn't thought about adding a chandelier -- that could be fantastic! And you're right about the rug and the chairs. Thanks for pointing that out. I had thought to paint the legs, but at this point I think I just want to find something new. User 6: I like your green walls. The gold framed mirror works well with it, but the walls need some more filling up. Also, the styles don't match very well, with the table and cabinet being more farmhouse and the chairs and rug being more scandinavian.  Swap the table for something more scandinavian looking. You would normally associate this style with light wood, but there is also furniture in darker finishes.   The wall with the mirror is the place to put a credenza/sidboard. Make sure it covers moste of the width of that wall, so it doesn't hide behind the dining table. Stick with the scandi style, but to really make it pop, you may want to go with a lighter colour. I would choose something in walnut and white. Balance the mirror better to the wall by decorating the top of the credenza with plants, candles, and anything else that will fit in a dining area. Bring some more gold into the mix here.   Your rug is does not do on this floor. It is too beige and blends into this highly patterned floor. As has been suggested, you may want to choose a more monochromatic coloured rug. A (off)white rug will work, or something light grey or a very light green. You may also want to consider a larger size rug. OP: Thanks so much for these suggestions! You are totally right about the clashing styles. I want to get rid of the farmhouse pieces in favor of a more scandinavian look. Good call about the length of the sideboard -- that was something I was struggling with. And others have called out the rug, too. I think you're all correct that we need to swap it out. User 5: Follow up to my comment--  Here's some inspiration -- [this dining room has blue walls and a pink painted table]([URL] Imagine your room with green walls and an orange painted table. OP: I never would have thought of this! Thanks for the link! User 5: What I like about this room is those chairs should absolutely not \"go\" with that table. They are totally different styles. Yet painting the table in a wild color makes it work.  I would not paint your chair legs though. That is a very popular Eames-inspired style so don't mess with them in case you want to sell them later. The table on the other hand is something I probably wouldn't hesitate experimenting with. OP: Oh yeah, definitely. I wouldn't mess with the chairs, but the table, why not?! Someone else suggested a round table, and while I think that would probably fit better in the space, I might as well play around with this one to see if I could make it work. OP: I have been struggling to figure out how to arrange this space, so I am bringing my question to you. I have this dining space between the kitchen (to the right -- behind a cut-out wall) and the very 1980s recessed living room (to the left, behind the half wall). The space is 9' wide and around 10' long.  Looking to add storage (a sideboard/ credenza/ cabinet/ bar?) and to replace the $100 craigslist table I bought 5 years and 4 moves ago. Also open to suggestions for the wall with the mirror. I am located in the US and have budget of around $1500. Willing to spend more, hopefully less.\n",
            "User 59 - zgbb26 Original Post: Ordered this Coach bag and now unsure - do you think this will look dated very soon? Image: a coach mini shoulder bag with an adjustable strap. User 1: Tabby keeps getting revamped and reintroduced, which I think proves that the style is here to stay. Fendi has made variations of a baguette for decades now-its not going anywhere any time soon! User 2: Agreed! I think it's shape is quite standard, and design is fairly simple, which lends itself well to having some longevity User 3: If you don't totally love it, don't buy it. The fact that you post this shows you already have buyer remorse and won't enjoy the bag. Maybe better to cancel the order if you're unsure :) User 4: The only thing that gives me pause as to looking dated is that gigantic C hardware. I wish companies would have subtler branding. User 5: I’d buy so many more bags if they didn’t have their logos plastered everywhere. I probably would’ve even gotten the Marc jacobs tote bag if it didn’t say Marc jacobs tote bag User 6: They make a version without the monogram but yes I agree User 4: Without the gigantic C hardware? Or are you talking about the fabric? I honestly don't mind the fabric, but that hardware is too much for me; maybe if it were thinner and smaller, it would look nicer, but it just looks like a balloon animal. User 6: I misread your comment sorry! The Cassie 19 looks similar to this but with a much more understated logo! User 4: Yes, I prefer Cassie 19 hardware. User 7: I agree. I think the huge C is just way too much. User 8: This will always look similar to a vintage bag. It's really up to you if like vintage or not User 9: It’s timeless. I prefer the leather version without the monogram C print, but it’s not that bad on the Tabby! Baguette bags will always be in style. User 10: It already looks dated. But in a retro way. So it depends on if you like it. User 11: Hi! I got this in brass/dark stone last week and I love it. It’s so functional with the two straps. It fits a lot of things surprisingly. And it’s light. I’m really happy with it. I’m more of a neutral colour person and not a big fan of logos so that’s why I picked the solid colour one. Never been a Coach person but when I saw it I was so impressed with the stitching and quality so I had to buy it. I think yours looks great as well as long as you’re okay with the logo design in the middle. User 12: I got the tabby top handle 20 which is essentially the same with this one. It looks quite nice and very well made! It doesn’t have anything super trendy on it IMO, so probably won’t look dated anytime soon.  Go for it! User 13: I think it just depends on your preference for canvas. Some like it some don’t. I think this purse is super cute and can be dressed up or down! User 14: I have two - a black and a white. The Tabby gets new versions every now and then. If you like wearing neutral colours, it will surely be timeless. It looks good on whites, browns, and blacks. User 15: It’s classic and looks very nice. You should try to separate your taste from what is trending now and what won’t be trendy later. If you really like a bag, you’ll wear it even if it’s not a timeless peace. User 16: Don't worry! Once it's in your hands, it may be spark joy.  If not, you can always return it 🤗\n",

I’m thinking the clutch and necklace on the left, but is that too casual for a wedding? Image: an elegant dress and a purse is featured in the ad. User 1: The clutch suits perfectly fine. I think the necklace might be a bit much, maybe try something more dainty or perhaps long earrings instead of a necklace. I think earrings will keep there focus on the dress more OP: Yes I think you’re right. I’m definitely not a “less is more” person so sometimes I feel naked without a lot of accessories haha. But I do think long earrings would look nice here User 2: Indoor or outdoor wedding? If indoor bring a shawl because you might get cold in the AC. OP: Hmm I’m actually not sure lol, all I know is that it’s in the afternoon at a country club. I’m hardly ever cold though unless it’s like 20 degrees out haha User 3: I would make sure to have a wrap/shawl/sweater no matter the weather... OP: Why is that? It’s gonna be pretty hot at the end of August haha User 3: A little modesty insurance in case the wedding venue is chilly... OP: I think I will be fine but thanks for your concern!

            "User 61 - ac84je Original Post: I got rid of a ton of stuff in my bathroom. Now it looks like we just moved in. How do I spruce up the shelves? Image: a corner shelf with several items in it and a picture on the wall. User 1: On 2 shelves - Use decorative baskets - ideally 1 or 2 baskets on each shelf that take up most of the opening. Do this instead of the plastic bins.  On 1 shelf put 4 large matching towels folded neatly.  On top shelf you may want to put something decorative - like a pretty box or 3 vases.    User 2: Consider rolling the towels instead of folding them to go with the rounded edges of the shelves.  User 1: Yeah, that’s a great idea. User 3: Maybe add pictures in one shelf, towels in another, decorative baskets in another, and everything else in the last User 4: Try to hide anything with branding labels   Plants would look nice here too  User 5: Decorative boxes from Ikea can help along with some small display items or pictures. Fake or real plants (like succulents) could also add a touch of color.  Boxes from Ikea [URL]   User 6: Little plants if you have light in there!  User 7: You need two things - texture (towels, face cloths, washcloths, a painting) and life (potted plants or succulents). User 8: Rolled towels on the shelves? Practical but decorative.  Make your everyday items more decorative - decant mouthwash into a pretty vessel etc.  Like the plant idea.  User 9: If you can, I would paint the back and inside walls of the shelves User 10: Agreed, it would be a great spot for a fun color like turquoise or the like.  User 1: That would look amazing. User 11: How do the shelves correspond with your height? Depending on the height of the second and third shelves, add a small mirror with an area for skin and hair products at eye level. Even if you already have a mirror in the bathroom an additional reflective surface is functional adds depth to a small space. Then put at least one small potted plant on the mirror shelf with a decorative bathroom piece, such as a diffuser or a box with hand towels. Directly below this shelf, place a tray to put your toothbrush and small toiletries on. Fit three/four boxes snuggly into the remaining shelf that is not the top shelf. Wood crates or wire baskets will have a nice contrast with the white wood depending style of the rest of the room. Fill these boxes with toilet paper, extra toiletries or even nothing, just make sure to fill the space. If you don't want to see through the gaps in the boxes you can buy or DIY slip bags to fit inside the boxes and conceal the contents. Finally, finish the top shelf with potted plants and ambient light. Real candles will likely burn the wood, but battery powered candles or a salt rock lamp might look nice (albeit a little hippy-ish). ZZ and Snake plants are low maintenance, they will grow with little to no natural light as and thrive with infrequent watering.   Cool bathroom fixture! The shelves are so unique, can't wait to see what you do with the space.  User 12: Baskets of various sizes and shades. Textural yet practical. User 13: If it's not a rental, you can pry off that curved trim, re-touch, re-paint. Then get some matching linen cubes to fill the shelves. Or add a door so it all disappears.   Otherwise I like the idea of rolled towels in here. User 14: A nice plant, a reed diffuser User 15: Add towels and take a look at r/skincareaddiction OP: My skincare is in the closet on a roll cart now :)  User 16: Plants?  OP: No light :(  And it’s a small bathroom so it gets realllly steamy or I’d consider fake  User 17: Put a plant on the top one.  Space your stuff evenly on the lower shelves and it'll look nicer even without fancy baskets. User 18: I love how the openings are shaped! I think you should showcase those by painting them a different color and then buy some decorative boxes to store toiletries and spruce it up with small bathroom friendly plants.  OP: Get some toothbush caps, cause everytime you booboo, booboo particles are released and get on everything.  User 19: You have to be joking...\n",
            "User 62 - xmx34i Original Post: What do you think of the Tiara with the dress? Dress has not been altered yet. Afraid it could be too costume-y. Wedding in December. Image: a girl in a gown is looking at her phone. User 1: I think that specific tiara will overshadow you and it will be the only thing people are talking about.  You want them to be talking about you.  A *delicate*, gold tiara with that dress would be stunning.  Some kind of a cape in lieu of a veil would also be very chic. User 2: I do think it’s a little costume-y. I like them both separately but together not really. How do you plan on actually having your hair? OP: I’m not sure yet. I have a hair trial on Tuesday so maybe I’ll bring it and have the hairdresser work with it to see if we can do something that works— I’ll post pic updates and see if the reaction is different— without hair and makeup it could be difficult to tell User 2: Yeah that’s what I’m thinking! Honestly it may just be the color of the dress that’s throwing people off, it’s a lot of gold all together. I look forward to seeing the update! OP: Thanks! I was sort of hoping the pearls would add a hint of white, maybe with hair done it will look a little different. User 3: It might look different if you had a tall updo? User 4: I don't think they coordinate very well and the effect is, as you put it, costumy. id go with a shorter tiara without pearls. User 5: I’m going to be honest. It giving Statue of Liberty 😅 OP: I sort of feared this User 6: i thought the same, sorry User 7: Was about to write this exact comment word for word. User 8: Love the dress. Smaller tiara. User 9: It’s always best not to guild the lily. When the dress is fancy best to go simple with accessories. This kind of gives me a Queen of England vibe. Unless royalty is the theme, better to dial it back a little. User 10: the dress on its own is great. it fits you really well and even unaltered looks awesome! But the tiara is pretty bad (sorry). If youre going with a gold gown, you need to keep your accessories a bit simpler (imo). User 11: Gorgeous dress, definitely tiara worthy but not one with big balls. You need a dainty diadem and a cape veil also in gold would be awesome. User 12: Yessss I agree with this! Diadem is actually a more suitable head piece for this dress ⭐️ User 13: I agree that it does look a little costume-y. But if you like it that’s all that matters. ❤️ User 14: I’m all for a tiara but not *this* tiara. It does give it more of a costume look.   The dress is lovely and already stands out so I’d opt for a quieter tiara or headband - something that won’t fight with the dress. User 15: I like the tiara and I think you should wear one! But I don’t like the tiara with this dress User 16: You know what, it’s unusual, but I love it. You look like a queen! OP: Thank you!! It’s a big statement so it’s a little nerve-wracking pulling the trigger on this. User 17: It looks very \"Anastasia\" to me, and I am ALLLLL for that, especially for a December wedding! User 18: Once upon a December!!! User 19: Absolutely love the dress. I think you need to go with a simple tiara, though. A more delicate one would look lovely with it. User 20: I think the tiara itself feels a *teensy* costume-y but I love this dress and the vibe of the overall ensemble. User 21: I like it, it’s giving me medieval queen vibes. Very unique and memorable in a good way! At the end of the day, the traditional big princess dress with the cathedral veil is also very costume-y. OP: Thank you for this! I know people have said that all wedding are costumey but I didn’t consider the fact that so many brides want to look all “princess-y” which also comes off as kind of a costume, but it’s more accepted because it’s more of the norm. I was kind of thinking “I don’t want to be a princess, I want to be a queen 👸🏻” lol User 22: My thoughts exactly!  I personally love it. I think you should totally lean into the golden queen vibe. Memorable and unique and dramatic!      I would pair it with a fairly simple updo, with some volume, and then a white silk chiffon, silk gauze, or silk tulle veil flowing down behind the crown for a slightly opaque look! User 23: I don't think they complement each other. The dress is lovely and would benefit from a more understated headpiece. User 24: I don’t want to confuse things, but I’m actually kind of obsessed. It reminds me of the runway or the MET gala a few years back. This with like a dark lip and dewy, glowy makeup 🤌🏼 But, that’s if you want drama! I think it’s you’re day and you should do whatever you want. User 25: I don't like thetiara, the pearls are too big and distract from the beauty of the dress. It reminds me of the statue of liberty. User 26: I see in your comments OP that you want to feel like a queen. You most definitely look very regal in your dress with this tiara 👑 if it makes you feel amazing then go for it! Your dress also looks stunning on you! User 27: So unique and fun AND beautiful. It looks a little bit costume-y but I think a lot of that has to do with the dress being a little bit big. Once you get the dress altered everything will look more cohesive and elegant and I would love to see the result!!! OP: Thank you! I think once the dress is altered it will have a much different effect User 28: Love it!! What other event can you wear a tiara?? Go for it and it looks lovely!! User 29: I like it, fits the dress. Wear it with confidence and you'll be radiant! User 30: I love this look. It's got a vintage vibe to it and the headpiece is perfectly paired. It's not the same old thing, so you'll be really striking at your event and people will remember it fondly I'm certain. OP: This is my hope! Thank you! User 31: My exact thoughts User 32: Love the dress, the tiara, and the combination!!! User 33: I think all wedding outfits are costumes. This look is fire and you should go for it! User 34: I love the dress and think it's doing great things for you, but I don't think the tiara works with it. The dress is a statement piece, but the tiara is trying to be a statement as well (a totally different one). At first glance, the large pearls looked like light bulbs to me, possibly because the white really sticks out compared to your coloration and the dress's. I think you could find something else that would be more cohesive. User 35: You’ll look beautiful, memorable and completely unique as a bride. Wear with confidence and you’ll rock it 😬 User 36: It’s not my thing but it looks great on you! I’m wearing a hot pink dress and people who don’t like it can piss off. It’s your wedding! Make yourself happy!! User 37: If u love it, wear it. It’s gorgeous, unique, tasteful, and memorable. Your wedding is the perfect time to make a statement with your outfit ❤️❤️ User 38: Love the dress 1000%. User 39: I vote yes do it 👑 User 40: I love the combination. User 31: I actually love this.

Very cute space btw User 14: I think round makes sense, but really it depends on how you use it.  e.g. if you use the table to play boardgames or do puzzles or as a workspace, you might want something square or rectangular.  Or maybe one of those mid century expanding tables for when you need a bit extra. User 15: Steamer trunk User 16: maybe something like this but the color of your trim on the walls  [[URL] User 17: A round upholstered ottoman so you can put your feet up! User 18: I was also going to suggest an ottoman with a large thrifted tray — beautiful space. Love all the colours and textures. User 19: Round storage ottoman - we always need more storage!

User 21: I LOVE this for the room but it looks a little long . Such a nice choice though User 22: I would go clear User 23: I love the rug!! User 24: To balance out the round coffee table suggestions I think rectangular could also work, especially with rounded corners and a 'light' frame.  Something [like this]([URL] Although personally I'd invest in time to find a cheaper version rather than invest in this table. ;) User 25: I absolutely love this room. Something similar in that spot, maybe from a thrift store would be awesome. A round portait photo on the wall on the right could also be nice but your room looks good as is User 26: SO nice room.please try to replace the [carpet]([URL]) to match you room well.🙂  Can.t waiting for your next share.😄 User 27: I was initially going to say a dark wood, triangle shaped table with gold legs to match your curtain rod, and other golden accents around the room.   But then I found this small trio of [tables]([URL] that I think would fit nicely in this room. And it’s very practical if you have someone in the chair and on the couch, everyone can have their own table. User 28: Everyone is saying round, but I think oval would be better. A round one would take up too much space and there would be less usable space for people sitting on the ends of the couch, where most people typically sit. Oval all the way. User 29: I’d say get a funky triangular one! User 30: White or Swiss coffee color with similar size. it will bring the top white colors down and draw a natural tendency to look at the whole space (up and down)  If not, if you continue with a brown or dark colored table, add a white or light colored rug underneath. I’d say a faux fur one. But they’re not the funnest to maintain User 31: I think a long, narrow table would look great. Even a long oval. I think it would look smashing mirrored. User 32: See if you can find an antique trunk or chest with a flat top.  I just got a cedar chest with wheels.  It's great storage. User 33: That ark/ truck ffit very well in the room, and you already know that now. So my suggest will come in a different style. Try a Tulip Table. Is rounded, without legs (one base), and it has several choices for its top, like plastic fiber or marble. I would say white with marble top. The window will be smiling with a little string light hanging from above. User 34: Hang a [large abstract wall art]([URL])  on the wall behind the sofa.\n",

I just had someone dislike the white puffy clouds because they were too feminine for him. So......Just thought I'd get your ideas as a come back.

I think the room looks pretty feminine User 4: Yeah sorry op, but I agree! User 5: I love the color scheme. It's unique and aesthetic. User 6: Yes but then the twinkle lights kill it 🌝 looks nice 🌸 User 7: I think the lights set off the clouds.  It's nice! User 8: I agree! The lights to me, at least, screams feminine. User 9: It's gender neutral with or without it. User 7: Absolutely love it! What a relaxing, restful area.  Love It!!! User 10: Everything in this photo is gender neutral to me. User 2: Bro, is it gay if I like……the sky??? User 11: Depends on which sky gods you believe in I guess. User 12: I love the design!! OP: Thanks. User 13: Where did you get the bedding? OP: Wayfair  &#x200B;  [[URL] User 13: Thank you User 14: I would take down the fairy lights to make it more gender neutral. They’re super cute but definitely more feminine. I don’t think the paining makes much of a difference in the tone of the room and it’s gorgeous! OP: Thank you. I believe I will take the lights down for a while. I have some white fluffy clouds, too. I may try them and post again. User 15: Still looks girly somehow User 16: Well I think it does, me myself when I look at it it's saying be calm, but the room it self looks more for a boy but that's my opinion. But it looks great.\n",

User 1: Needs some character on the wall. Just cause he’s 13 doesn’t mean it needs to be tacky either. Get some cool art OP: Thanks, would posters do the trick? Or should I install wall shelves for my books and LEGO builds. User 2: I bet he'd appreciate shelves if he likes Legos.  Why not ask him? OP: I am him User 3: This is hilariously funny to me. User 4: whoosh User 5: It is great that you're interested in creating your space at your age.  &#x200B;  There are a lot of things you can do to make it more interesting. I might spend some time looking for ideas on [Youtube]([URL] While a lot of what you'll find may look girly, it's worth a look because the colors can be changed from pink and yellow to more dude colors and use more masculine materials, like natural rope or wood. If you find one cool idea you can adapt for your own room, it's was worth the watch.  What works well in a lot of youth bedrooms is [Bulletin boards]([URL]  When I was 13 (a budding interior designer) I cut out images from magazines and \"framed\" them with black poster board (you can get it at the dollar store or staples) I used [spray adhesive]([URL] (sometimes called photomount)  to glue the picture without wrinkles. I space the picture in the corner of the board, leaving an inch or so around the edges, and pencil mark the corners. Then spray the back of the picture (laid on newspaper) and smooth it in place and then cut out the other sides. It elevates something you printed from the internet. Use push pins (not thumbtacks) to hang (the holes actually fill with paint, when you repaint).  What I have seen work well is a horizontal band painted around a room, like a high water mark, maybe 2.5 ft. to 3 ft. wide and the bottom level with the desk top. this is an area where you can pin art and what ever, maybe even add a couple of hat hooks. Use painters tape to mark the top and bottom and remove the tape before the paint drys (if the paint completely drys the tape chips the edges).  I am not a fan of black and white color schemes, but it seems a lot of guys are. But, I would encourage you to introduce color.  The bed could be elevated, with a homemade [pallet board bed frame]([URL] It's a good first time woodworking project.  Lights help decorate a space more than anything. You should be aware of three kinds, General (overhead, floor lamps bounced off the ceiling or walls), Task (desk lamp, night stands, end tables) and mood (candles, small lights, sconces, [string lights]([URL] Even back-lighting furniture, like placing [Monster illuminessence lights]([URL] behind an open bookcase). Your workspace could benefit from a desk lamp.  Anything you do will be an improvement, so don't worry about trying things out, everything can be undone and redone. Look at your room as your \"design laboratory\" where you can try out different ideas.  hope that helps. User 6: Black accent wall with diagonal stripes in like grays and whites. Make the art pop. Also very DIY-able and would make a good weekend project for under $75 (USD) User 7: Need a headboard for that bed.  A mirror for the wall, unless the dresser already has one.    A basic classy video gaming print, framed. Or whatever his hobbies are.  I prefer to keep walls neutral and accent with wall pieces.  The wood floors ground it all pretty well.  Maybe a chest/foot locker for the end of the bed, doubles as a bench. User 8: Agree about the art work. Also pick the bed off the floor and get a headboard, etc. User 9: Headboard for the bed. Framed Print(s) above the bed. Floating shelves above the desk with some drooping plants (+ your lego). Bedside table with a cool lamp. User 10: Get some LED light strips on amazon. The ones with the sticky stuff on the back so you can just tape it onto whatever you want with no problem. They look super cool and are a good way light your room up. User 4: ask him what colors he wants and paint the walls, white is dreadfully boring in a small room like that. Maybe put up wall shelves by the computer desk if he has stuff he wants to put on display. Also 100% agree with getting a headboard for the bed and art for the walls like other people have been saying.  And finally because it's basically an obligation for someone to bring this up in the comments of every /r/malelivingspace thread, a plant on the desk would look really nice if that's something he'd want. OP: I like the white and there is a bookshelf under the picture and another slightly to the left of this picture out of shot. User 11: Shop around for a rug that you think looks cool.  * Get paintings/prints (with affordable frames if you have the money) and place them where you wish there was a window. * Get low light plants. * With [Planters]([URL] * Place a rug or rugs.  [With color.]([URL] * Get colorful [throw pillows]([URL] for sofa or bed or even a chair.  There’s a million online. * A Bookshelf than can hold [both books and also visual objects]([URL] like plants, colorful antiques, gadgets, sculptures, art.  My tips are for adults, because kids can’t usually afford planters or bookcases, but I’m not going to dumb it down for you my friend.  That’s the truth.  And plants are cool.  Black chairs are common, but they are drab and not very fun.  I like light colored chairs.  But this can be a waste of money if your chair feels fine.  . . And get on **Pinterest** for interior design.  Reddit is god-awful for stuff like this.  The [sub for femalelivingspaces]([URL] is also really good, women seem more creative at throwing together the right elements on average if you compare both subs.  And the results aren’t “female” in any exclusive way, the results are excellent brilliant interior design in general. User 5: Or skip pinterest, a site that encourages people to steal from other sites, and use the good ideas you find on this fine sub. User 3: I'd run a shelf all around the room about 2 feet down from the ceiling, then put stuff on it-- storage, plus decorative if styled nicely.  You like the white, that's fine! Just add color and texture elsewhere-- pick a palette (you've got the black and white already, add two colors-- red or yellow and orange, if you like things vibrant, or blue and green if you like things a bit cooler/more calm).   A better bedframe would transform the bed, plus give storage opportunities under the bed and even in the headboard, if you got a bed frame that had a shelf-y-type headboard.  An area rug would warm up the floor figuratively and literally. Nice big art in black frames would look great against the white walls. I'd add curtains in your red/yellow/orange or blue/green tertiary colors, to soften and give light and privacy control. Chuck a few plants in there, and it's done! OP: Would posters, bed frame, and colorful bed spread do the trick? User 3: They'd be a good start, as long as the colors coordinate. Get a bedframe in metal (black iron? oiled bronze?)  and a bedside table (you can use a stool or flat-seated chair, if you can't get an actual little table or cabinet-style thing with a drawer) and stick a lamp on it, maybe a small plant? You can get them cheap in a lot of supermarkets.  I suggest you take your favorite poster and pick 2 colors from it, one color not too bright (so like dark red or navy blue or forest green) and then something bright. Get the bedspread in the not-bright color and a throw pillow in the bright color. Maybe the lamp or lampshade could be the bright color, too.   If you end up getting curtains at some point, stick to plain white OR the solid not-bright color OR a print/pattern that has the not-bright and bright colors in it.  It can be a work in progress, okay to put it together one bit at a time over the course of a few months.\n",

It gets hot in the afternoon sun so I have a double curtain rod with black out in front and sheer in the back right now. User 9: is that a window or a sliding glass door? If its a window, you should be able to set your sectional in front of it and then put your tv on the opposing wall. which will open up space to the right of the tv for an accent chair. It will also make your room look a lot bigger  edit if you go with this route, plant in the left corner, accent right corner near entry way and large rectangular horizontal mirror on left wall along with framed artwork  edit 2: didnt see dog bed, put that on the bottom right corner User 13: Plants User 14: I saved this to my references/inspirational faves so.. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ User 6: I would suggest a large piece of art above the TV, obviously keep it in theme.

Handsome, tall plants User 19: If possible, I think the dog bed in the corner would be a great spot for some sort of house plant. Some shelves above the T.V. and a different color accent wall might also help. Overall it looks really good man. User 20: Plants Hang your tv on the wall User 21: Wall mount the tv User 22: I just want to say  really dig that circular shelf. User 23: It looks great! My only comment is that the white wall looks a little heavy with the lamp, couch, and 3 pieces of art on it. I'd wallmount the TV and put some books/pictures/plants underneath it (a piece of driftwood might look cool actually!) and then hang something to the left of the TV.  Even the woven wall hanging you've got on the white wall would look good. Otherwise, as someone else suggested, a taller floor plant or hang a vine plant like an ivy, pothos, or philodendron from the ceiling in the corner maybe? User 24: All it's missing is plants imo User 25: P L A N T S ! User 2: Move that dog pillow or whatever it is somewhere else  &#x200B;  Get a plant (snake is good there) and put it where the pillow thing is  &#x200B;  Ribba picture ledge (long) and some framed artwork and little things above the tv set would work. You could put one of those deer antler things a lot of hipsters have above it all to match the deer on the wall if you want to accentuate height.  &#x200B;  I think you could do with a bigger rug but after spending coin on my own little one I know how that goes wrt bigger rugs being $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ User 26: I really like it.  As someone pointed out, I think you could use something above the TV  - could be a painting, shelving, etc. (kind of like [this]([URL]  Also, I'd add a plant somewhere near where you've got that brown pillow (or dog bed?) on the ground.

Image: a living room with two leather sofas and a small coffee table. User 1: “Sorry I didn’t tidy up” um, this looks better than my apartment 100% of the time User 2: Pendant lights are great for places over tables and islands. Otherwise, a tall person will constantly hit his/her head on it when walking by.   I would add recessed lighting and update the flush-mount fixture. OP: 😂 Good to know. My 6’3” fiancé will appreciate you filling me in on pendant lights.   Do you have a specific idea for the flush mounts? User 3: As a tall person with short in-laws.... Thank you. Their house is an obstacle course. User 2: I'm a short person. I still think it's weird to put pendant lights in places where there's not a table under them. User 3: You're not wrong. I guess most of theirs are more like chandeliers... But still too low for the space. User 2: If a light hangs down more than a few inches, it needs a table under it. User 4: Check out Lamps Plus for ideas on attractive flush mount fixtures. User 5: Look for semi-flush mount lights. They sit off of the ceiling a bit to give them more architectural character, but they do not hang as low as pendants. User 6: Lamps!  Lamps are wonderful. OP: So I actually have lots of lamps for night time. During the day it’s a very bright space. But I just hate the look of these ceiling lights. I don’t know how to freshen them up! User 2: If the lights aren't needed, remove them and patch the sheetrock. It requires some DIY, and you would have to paint the ceiling. However, lamps > overhead lighting.

            "User 70 - gpwcqm Original Post: My dining area doesnt have any Windows, it's not a separate room but sort of part of the hallway. I'm good at diys and would like to stay on a budget Image: a living room with a table, chairs and guitar wall hangings. User 1: Looks great! Just some simple suggestions below. Will you be painting the walls at all?   Larger rug. When you pull the chairs out they should still be on the rug.   Buffet cabinet under the mirrors and you can make it your bar area.   The mirrors need to be painted because they blend into the wall. Or remove them and turn the pic the other way.   Frame those albums with matting to really make them stand out.   Put a big bowl in centre of table and fill with your fave fruit you can grab on your way out biking. OP: We decided not to paint since the walls are so high and the white kinda keeps it bright. When I bought the rug I figured it was too small damn it, the space isnt really bigger than what's in the picture, should the rug still be small enough to not touch the corners of the room??   Also, what color should I use to paint to mirrors? I really want to keep them because they brighten up the room during the day. User 2: Definitely don't let the rug touch the walls, but it could be closer to the walls if you got a bigger one User 3: I would either go with the orange of your guitar for a pop of color or the blue of your chairs. User 4: So looking at it right now, the distance it is away from the back wall with the mirrors but should be roughly that distance away from the other two walls. If I were to make a rough guess, yours is a 5'x7' or 6'x8' rug - you'd want to go one size up like a 7'x9'.   Colorwise on the accent wall, you could go with an orange or yellow that matches your guitars. User 5: I have no skills I can lend it to your attempt to rethink the look of your room, but one immediate thought was that you might want to take the strap off of the Sunburst guitar to the left, it makes some thing which should be really sleek and beautiful look a little bit cluttered. Just a thought, hope it helps!  (Also, I’m super curious: is that guitar on the left a Fender Jaguar?) User 6: It's a jazzmaster, can't tell the make User 7: Toanzmaster OP: As Simeone said, its a jazzmaster haha. My boyfriend plays it almost every day during the quarantine that's why the strap is on, but I'll keep it on mind! User 8: This is a large room with high ceilings. Each piece in this room is just a bit too small. To make it look balanced I would suggest taking down the small pieces of art as well as the small mirrors and exchanging then with much bigger pieces, and center the table and light a bit more, and add a credenza along that wall with the mirrors on it. A larger rug for sure, one that's not so dark. Maybe with some light blues and yellows. Even if u hung all three of those small squared pieces one on top of the other in a column to the left most part of that wall and then added some larger pieces or something. :) OP: I'm definitely going to get a bigger rug then.  They are actually records not pictures! We wanted to get more record frames and rearrange them User 9: I would be impressed by your place just seeing the Grace album c: User 2: I actually don't mind the rug, but there are indeed items that are clashing and the rug may not work with future configurations.   The first thing I notice is that your lovely teal chairs get a little lost in the different colors going on, and the lack of another similar teal to tie them in to the room. I would suggest perhaps painting the frames of the mirrors a similar blue, or change the art in between the mirrors with some tie-in colors. Something like [this]([URL] might look cool!  The overhead lighting is really nice but since there's no windows in the corner, it wouldn't hurt to add some more. A couple [wall sconces]([URL] where the mirrors currently are could look good, or one in between them, or one on the other wall. You can get some plug-in sconces that have nicely designed cords so that it looks tidy.   As for your music wall, cool, love it, personal, spices things up, etc., but I'd just suggest some symmetry. Doesn't necessarily have to be square, but symmetry is much more visually appealing, in my opinion.   And then maybe pop a big leafed green houseplant in the corner! Apparently philodendron are fairly low-maintenance.   These are just my suggestions and based on what I like! :) User 10: anyways here wonderwall... User 11: I love how the chandelier casts such interesting shadows on the ceiling, but I wish the chandelier was much much larger and more impactful.  Yes to larger rug. Or no rug.   Took me awhile to realize those were mirrors-- I thought the one on the right was some cool bicycle art. Heh. So here's an idea. Lower all three pieces on that wall a bit as they are too high and seem to be floating not grounded. Move the mirrors in closer to the art, to ground them in association with the art. Then paint the mirror frames orange like your guitar, or fire engine red, or maybe bright yellow. Something unexpected. Then paint on top of the mirror -- freestyle shapes, squiggles, lines, splatters or dots. I mean those are just garden variety mirrors you find at Target right? So why not turn the mirrors into DIY art? Unleash your inner child and finger paint them! Leave some of the mirror showing -- [example]([URL] OP: It actually looks kind of cool!  We got the mirrors because the room was so dark during the day and they help brighten it up, do you think they would have the same effect? User 12: In my layman’s eyes, I feel like everything looks too small for this room.  I would exchange the two mirrors with one huge one that could reflect your “biking” area, which seems aesthetically pleasing from what I can tell.  It also adds a bit of personality to the space.  The rug should be bigger too.  I would get a rug big enough so that when you pull the chairs back, it will still be on the rug.   Left wall arts, I would also exchange them for something bigger or I would add way more images like that to cover a bigger area.   When you say DIY, can you build your own furnitures? I reckon it would be cool if you could build a nice little wooden console to place to the side where you can leave your drinks / condiments etc when you’re having a big meal. OP: I actually did the top of that table :). I was trying to get a big mirror but it was waaaaay out of my budget and we ended up getting 2 smaller ones and we made that painting. I'll look up those wooden consoles. The things on the left wall are actually records User 13: Essentially - the mirrors need to be more visually interesting (to balance the guitar wall), and the rug needs to be bigger (to make the chairs looks less crowded). If you take the strap off your starburst there it will improve that wall too. The light shade is too lightweight for this area, it will be improved if it's visually heavier or more interesting (to balance the rug).   DIY ideas - make the mirrors look like windows (google \"mirrors that look like windows\" and you'll see what I'm getting at). Also, buy some old traditional style rugs, and patchwork them together - it would even work if you found a bunch of old rugs with holes in them, cut them apart, dyed them awesome colours, and patched them together - if you google \"patchwork rug\" you will see if this look is for you. Lastly, the light shade - see if you like any really colourful light shades in an image search. There is always inspiration to be found there - I saw a half-globe, some feathery ones, and I thought maybe even if you use the same shade you've got but hang colourful guitar picks from it?  With diy skills you have so many options, and with a funky musician vibe there is so much you can do. Enjoy!! Good luck!! User 14: Put a good size mirror on the wall that can reflect a window. Then hang some plants or put in a shelf in that area too. There are plants that will do fine without direct sunlight. User 15: Take down the mirrors.   Larger rug.   Maybe paint the table legs a contrasting color. User 16: Something I'm going to do is add vinal records User 17: If you like plants, you might want to consider a large faux plant to add some color like [this]([URL]  one. OP: I do love plants and we have a LOT but I cant figure out which large one I could get that survives in here, a snake plant seems a bit too boring User 18: I personally wouldn't have any real plants in a room with no light. I'd just have fake ones because 1hour of lighting isn't enough for any plant.   I think waxy types look more realistic than leafy types but you can get fake trees, ferns, birds of paradise, monstera. Big glossy leaves look more real to me. User 14: Put a good size mirror on the wall that can reflect a window. Then put some plants on the shelf that are not too overwhelming in size. There are plants that will do fine without direct sunlight. Maybe put a guitar on either side of the mirror. But make sure you also have things on the wall that will balance the mirror wall. OP: I'll give the plants a try! Sadly there is no wall that could reflect a window User 19: i would suggest adding bigger/longer mirrors and maybe flipping the painting in the middle. you could add more albums higher up to fill in the space on the other wall as well User 20: Gosh I love it just as it is.  Maybe a different rug tho. User 21: Add things on the floor like large plants or those slender side tables or cabinets against a wall User 22: You have a a great room with lots of wonderful suggestions already. I do think a bigger rug would help a lot. If you decide to do a rug, I think you should do something [like this]([URL] and really play up the guitars and chairs, which will help brighten the room up as well. I would add an oversized, colorful mid-century clock that takes up the mirror wall (couldn’t find a great example, but please ask more questions if needed!). You could also get a third mirror, paint the framing red and stack them horizontally on the wall. For the guitar wall, you could frame the three albums (like someone mentioned) and place them in a row, then use picture lighting (like museums have) to highlight the albums. Or if you have more albums, then you could turn it into an album gallery wall. So many fun options. I’d just play with various ideas and have fun with it. A colorful, mid-century style would be awesome in this dining room though! OP: Thank you! I feel like the type of rug you recommended would really give it a more mid century look! I also like your idea with the mirrors User 22: Yay! You’ll have to post what you end up doing after all these comments! OP: Larger rug. Bigger table. Maybe a contrast wall or even a curtain wall. Bar cart. User 23: I think it would look nice with a larger rugs. Maybe one of those large mirrors that have window trim User 24: It looks perfect the way it is now. User 25: It looks like some Moulding or something just barely in frame at the left mid side of the photo, can you show more what the rest of that wall looks like? It'll be easier to suggest balancing the guitar wall when we can see the rest! User 26: Larger rug for sure User 27: It looks like everything is crammed into the corner.  I know that there's probably more floor space on the left because it's part of the hallway, but based on the length of the wall on the left it looks like it's still kind of crammed into the corner.  I would try pulling the table further away from both walls and consider moving the guitars/records on the left wall so they're more spaced out along the wall. User 28: Something nobody mentioned yet, but do something about the lighting! Start with another chandelier, which projects the light to the ceiling (instead of down), creating nice indirect light. Additionally, add some self standing lights, maybe in the corner, or on a credenza. I would say the current setup is good functional lighting but does not create an atmosphere. You could also play with a piece of artwork (photo) that is back-lit, which would act as a type of window. User 29: I think a larger rug and hang a large mirror horizontally centered with the table. User 30: Mirrors that look like windows would be super cool, but also... what about framing a poster of some cool scenery in the middle of them..? Maybe making a window like frame for that too.  Larger rug.. and a case of fresh flowers! Haha User 31: Get a buffet and a really tall piece of art OP: Here are a few more pictures of the room! The weird urtinure on the left are from out old apartments and we're trying to get rid of it and add shelves or something like ikea vittsjö (sorry for the mess) [URL] User 32: Looks good, I would put a plant in the corner. User 33: Plants and mirrors are a good place to start. Maybe put something on the center of the table like a red bromeliad. (Something with a  bold color) OP: Those actually need a bright indirect light lol User 33: Get a fake one User 34: A Fender Bassbreaker 007 would look/sound great in there User 35: If this is a dining nook and the wall with the guitars/albums doesn't extend much further than shown here, I would maybe paint it the same teal as your chairs and leave the other wall white.  Then maybe rearrange the guitars so they're one above each other or have them further apart and make sort of a gallery out of your albums along with a larger framed poster or two of your favorite band(s) that might compliment the colors you have here?   Otherwise, agree with others: bigger rug either in neutral or more blue tones and then maybe rotate the art/mirrors or get bigger mirrors.   Nice Jeff Buckley album cover!\n",
            "User 71 - fcgrks Original Post: We just painted the orange and blue and don’t like the orange! What would look better?? Image: a kitchen with a metal sink, wooden counter, and orange cabinets. User 1: Blue OP: Like same color blue?? User 1: I think so. Having them match in that electric blue color would flow better than the contrasting color. I’d also consider a soft sky blue for each. OP: Thanks!! User 2: Do you have inspo-pics or what you’re going for? Hard to tell in the current pic given the lighting and the unfinished-ness of the room. OP: It’s a tiny home so we are trying to keep it minimal but wanted to add pops of color here. The color palette we’ve been Kinda playing around with is mainly white with pops of orange, blue and green.  Edit—if you look in my post history you can see what the space looks like before we painted the cabinets. User 3: Maybe switch out the orange for a soft lighter yellow? Alternatively, switching out the blue you have now with a darker shade of blue could help make everything less jarring. Color combination guides like [THIS ONE]([URL] may give you guys further inspo! OP: I was thinking about yellow! Thanks for your input I will check out that link. User 4: Mahogany User 5: I am not sure that either of these colours work with your counter top. If you do want to keep the blue, I would suggest pairing it with a navy blue on top or a cool red, that is on the darker side. OP: Thanks for the input! If we picked two new colors how would I find out what colors would go best with the countertop? User 5: The countertop is dark warm colour and the blue and organge are in the light and cool tone range. This is why I don't think they all work together. I think you can keep the blue if you pair it navy cabinets, especially since the bottom cabinets seem to be a little purple. Otherwise choose your blue and orange in warmer tones. OP: Thank you!!\n",
            "User 72 - fwrsaz Original Post: What to do with this?..... Image: a tv sitting on top of a tv stand in a room. User 1: Reading nook!! Or just a comfy seat :) User 2: Fish tank User 3: I think I'd place a low bookshelf there, or at least something to utilize the vertical space. I wonder what it was for originally - heating or cooling? User 4: Liquor User 5: Is there carpet on it? My initial assumption was a reading noock as well. Basically you have a built in desk or chair depending on its height. Also a good place to put like a dresser or some other thing you'd prefer not being in front of a wall. Depends entirely on your needs/preferences OP: It's just hard counter top type material. It is also an awkward height from the ground. 24\". so my feet barely touch the ground when I sit there. I thought of book shelf or dry bar, but back to awkward height but probably usable with some creativity. User 5: I'd personally put something like a bookshelf or a desk of some kind. Maybe could keep your consoles and videogames there if you're a gamer. So they're out of the way. User 2: How about a sculpture?  Are you Italian? How about a fountain? There's even an outlet there for it. User 6: Possibly a mini fridge. High enough off the ground you don’t have to bend over so far to get stuff inside. Or a popcorn maker. OP: Both maybe? Great suggestions! User 7: I, personally, would go for a beautiful shrine to the one and only Danny Devito. OP: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 you are inspirational! User 8: Plant, terrarium, bookshelf, time out corner lol User 9: Maybe get a thick piece of wood or cutting board to lay over it, you could put some sort of hanging light for decoration and a plant or sculptural piece of art. OP: That is a great idea. I like how that can really open up the doors to some creativity. OP: Reposted what the end result was! Not sure how to share it here. Still new to Reddit.\n",
            "User 73 - eelbb3 Original Post: Just bought my first house and need help making it feel like home. Would love any ideas especially related to paint colors. Image: a large open living room with couches and a tv. User 1: It needs softness - curtains, pillows, throw blankets, BIG area rug.  Also, plants. OP: I saw a cream rug that is 9x12. The room is 18x18 (but they are all connected)  Would that work? Or could I get away with 8x10? 8x10 has way more options.   Notes I couldn’t add it in the main post- it’s a fully naked room right now. None of that furniture is staying. User 2: 8x10 is gonna look like a postage stamp. Go bigger in a living room. User 1: Put your furniture in first, and see the layout that you like. Then get a rug large enough so you can put at least the front legs of your sofa and chairs on it. You can buy rugs online and have them delivered in a matter of days. User 3: Yep, rug is necessary User 4: I’d paint the whole space something similar to Behr’s Silver Drop—a nice, light neutral with a smidge of the same cool blue tones in the tile. I think the reason the blue in the tile stands out so much is that there are so many clashing colors in the room. Keep your walls and furniture more cool-toned and it should recede into the background. You can utilize the fireplace wall as an accent wall as the prior owners did if you like. Stick with the same color family, just a shade or two darker.   If painting the cabinets is in your budget, I think they’d look much nicer painted the same white/off-white as the trim surrounding the fireplace. Fill the space above the cabinets with potted plants or some large glassware or stoneware if you’re so inclined.   Does the large window have black blinds? Swap those out for some white faux wood blinds or roman shades if you’re fancy. Add some full-length curtains.   Replace the ceiling fan— it also clashes with the floor. Go for white or, if you’re feeling trendy, grey-toned wood.   In an open space like this, I’d also use area rugs to delineate the different “rooms.” As another poster said, you want one for the living area that’s large enough for at least the front legs of your sofa and chairs. I’d also find a coordinating (but not matching!) rug for the dining area, large enough for the table and all chairs to rest on when the chairs are pulled out for sitting. Maybe a wide runner for the kitchen, too. White or cream would be nice for the rugs, I think.   Overall, I think reducing the sort of orangey-brown colors in the room and keeping everything to more of a monochrome white/off-white/grey color scheme will be the best way to work with the tile. OP: Thank you for taking the time to leave such a detailed response! I looked up silver drop and I really love the color. Neutrals are my jam so you are 100% speaking my language.   Ceiling fan and rugs I am sure I can do fairly early. Cabinets may take some more time but I can see where you are coming from. Especially with the black counter top. Luckily they are wood so they can be redone without much issue.  Additionally, I saw a post where they painted the tiles around the opening of the fireplace. I am considering painting them the same white as the trim. Does this sound crazy or do you think it would look nice? I feel like the house has more than enough of the tile. User 4: I do think the tiles around the fireplace would look nicer if they were the same color as the trim. I’m not sure how durable it would be, but if others have done it, I’m sure they know. It sounds like this is more of an interim plan anyway, and you’ll eventually (maybe several years out) be replacing the tiles anyway, if I’m reading your post correctly. I’d say go for it!  Good luck and congratulations on the new house! Open floor plans like this can be challenging, because you want it to look cohesive but still have defined areas for different purposes. I think it’ll look great once you get it painted and styled. Make sure to keep us posted with your updates. User 5: I would LOVE to see this transformation, please update us! User 6: I literally just painted the tile in front of my fireplace! Humblebrag: it looks AMAZING (the tiles were actually already painted when I moved in, and for a variety of reasons, I didn’t want to demo).  I used this tutorial[this tutorial]([URL] with painters tape for my design instead of a stencil. You could definitely just do a flat color, though. I figured that my tiles were in a pretty low traffic area, so the paint would hold up just fine. Disclaimer... I haven’t lived with it so I could be totally wrong, lol.  DM me if you want more info or want to see the process/result pics. OP: Just got word yesterday that my husband and I are going to own this home in the next month. Right now I am very nervous and excited, when we toured it was very dark on the inside and the blue in the tile stood out aggressively. Since we will be keeping this flooring for a few more years, I would love guidance on how to paint to mellow out the floors a bit. I love cool neutral colors and a don’t fall into any one design style (just like my house or look lived in, cozy I think?)  Current furniture includes a 7ft low backed grey couch with squared strait arms. None of the furniture in the photo is staying. Dimensions of the living area are 18x18 but the floor plan is completely open with the kitchen (15x13), breakfast room (8x10) , dining room (14x11), entry way and living room (18x18) attached.   Day one plans include scrubbing the tile and grout and replacing the lightbulbs with some that are less yellow and slightly brighter. User 7: If the blue in the tile is that prominent, go very neutral on the wall colors. If you get excited about a feature wall, maybe green or a dark (navy) blue. But really, blue colors just absorb light. It sounds like it feels dim to you. I recommend a cream, toasted vanilla will feel warm and bright without looking brown. Rugs to break up the space. Then plants. So many plants. User 8: I like the teal, but maybe cover the mauve up with cream or light grey. Teal + mauve always reminds me of a hospital for some reason. User 9: I have that exact coffee table! It’s an ikea table from the late 80s/ early 90’s. Picked mine up off fb for cheap and restored it. It looks great in my minimalist themed living room. User 10: I would keep the blue.  It need art work , neutral color curtains and color on your pillows. Keep the neutral color. User 11: I will be following you update us after you make this house a home User 12: Great potential!  I'd do a light green (w. a hint of blue in a lighter shade than the kitchen. Keep the wall with the cabinets darker than the rest to visually pull it closer) Put ceiling to floor length curtains to either side of the window to frame it.  Get a huge warm rug in tones that harmonize with the floor. cabinets and sofa.  Edit: I saw you're bringing a grey couch - excellent. Put in neutral pillows and a throw to make it cozy, and a lamp for ambient lighting in that area.  I'd also put a larger piece of art above the fireplace or a series that fills the wall better in scale (think golden ratio)  Don't forget loads of flowers, put big ones on either side of the TV and on the side table.  You can even hang them to create \"areas\" for example to seperate the breakfast nook and make it a little more cozy and closer by pulling the eye closer with a plant. Directly in the eyeline from where you are standing close to the breakfast area.  Please keep us posted. OP: Thank you for responding! I am leaning towards greenery over flowers (less likely to murder it and allergies) but I agree it needs something living. I like the idea of using them as frames.   I plan to keep everyone posted and will respond after it’s painted and clean. Furniture is going to be a long road (I love thriftiness) but I will gladly share then too. User 13: Hi😃so I would repaint in a light flat light brown. All walls. Then change dining chandelier to something w wrought iron in it. Then the barstools, coffee tbe, end table all change to a black wood contemporary style. Add a beige traditional 8x10 rug and all set! User 14: Class it up with a dark gray; it's large enough and appears well-lit enough that it won't make it feel confining in my opinion.  OR maybe a light gray (maybe light blue-gray to match the tile) and then a dark, rich gray on the fireplace wall as an accent for some variation to make for a stronger focal point. User 15: Paint all the walls one color - a very light neutral taupe or very light warm grey. All the trim should be (stay) white.  Get a very large area rug - at least 9x12 - for the living room area. User 16: Rug please! User 17: It's a beautiful and spacious home, dont be afraid of adding too much.  Get some plants (varying in sizes)   The kitchen walls don't match the cabinets at all, try off white, pinkish and beige,  or even just a really light beige colour for the kitchen walls. It will make a huge difference.    The frame of the fire place doesn't match with anything, painting it a warmer colour that matches with the lighter tones of the floor tiles would do it great justice.  Also, it would be nice if  the coffee table, and the end tables match the frame of the fire place.    For the sofa, don't go for leather. If you do, ensure that it's less shiney,  and not brown.  Brown doesn't match with the walls of the living room. User 18: We are in a very similar situation, with an open floor plan that includes dated cabinets in kitchen, flooring that is good quality but doesn't suit us and a ton of other improvements to make besides the family room. For a couple weeks I checked Facebook Marketplace and a neighbor email group for good, slightly used furniture. Bought 4 good pieces for $1,000.  In talking to the furniture sellers, I found one is a furniture showroom saleswoman, one an interior designer and one a homeowner who'd done a remodel, so the furniture is quality, slightly used and an improvement. We were able to round up two custom modern maple office storage pieces with a drop down desk area, a slightly used espresso brown leather couch and a bedroom dresser in a better size and style than I currently have.   Have you established what style you want for this room - modern, farmhouse, transitional, or what style?  I'm leaning to modern for our house but it will be transitional until we have more of a budget. If you're going for modern, the fireplace surround / molding needs to be updated (replaced) the fan updated, the mauve and pink? walls changed. I can see this with modern bar stools, a big rug, keep the side table and perhaps the coffee table? And start buying good used furniture and adding pieces. I got my husband to begin appreciating what you could find - after shopping at a good furniture store & seeing those prices. Start with an established style and work towards that. Our favorite rug was found in a resort town, during a huge summertime rummage sale. $100!\n",
            "User 74 - pwnk0q Original Post: How would you style this non-working fireplace? Should we mount the TV or leave it where it is? Image: a blue fireplace and television in a room with hardwood floors. User 1: TV looks great where it is.  Please god do not mount it on that beautiful fireplace.  Perhaps hang a picture.  Candles look good.  Maybe look into a fire curtain/screen. User 2: They would need to watch tv standing. I would hang some wooden thai relief there and add a rgb light on the back. User 3: I think a round mirror would look nice User 4: I would style it with a sledgehammer but it seems a lot of people here like it. To me it looks like a crematorium. User 5: With you 100% User 6: 1000% User 7: I'm personally not a fan of t.v's over the fireplace. Is yours a Frame TV? Do you like where it is right now? Can we see more of your space? What's your decorating goal / style overall?   My first ideas were:   1. Consider hanging the art from the beam, rather than attaching to the brick.  2. The candles in the fireplace look like teeth, ha ha. I'm sure they look better IRL, it was just my first reaction! I love the look of white logs in fireplaces that aren't operational. Or [fill-a-log look]([URL] which can be a DIY type project and would work for your fireplace.   You don't necessarily need anything at all if you're going for a minimal look. You could do a [natural wood mantel]([URL] but it depends on your overall theme.   [Here is some more inspiration]([URL] -- does anything jump out at you in particular?   If you're worried about the ceiling slant a safe idea is a round piece of art or mirror. If you're worried about the asymmetrical nature of your fireplace, I wouldn't be-- I'd just go with it and line the art up with the beam rather than the fireplace. Off kilter art could look interesting here.   When in doubt, get out some painters tape and tape up whatever art and/or mantel you are considering.   But don't be afraid to just leave it blank as is either. The eye always needs a place to rest. Or maybe you want to draw attention elsewhere, like an awesome rug or whatever (we haven't seen the whole room so difficult to say). Note in that inspiration link the gigantic chandelier and blank fireplace wall (not saying you need a honking huge crystal chandelier, just saying that you might want the fireplace simple so the eye focuses on some other statement instead). User 8: Don’t put the TV above. Paint is the answer for the fireplace. Something dark. The two walls right and left in the same shade only lighter. At least a poster size art print above the fireplace. Be bold. I would take down the two shelves above the TV. You don’t need anything there. Simple and bright rules the day. User 9: Add a wooden mantle. Though I would personally demolish it User 10: The grey paint is really bad - I would repaint first. After that maybe put some art up and some sort of tall vase or plant or other decor on the empty side.   It’s such a big thing in your room… if you’re not getting rid of it maybe look into converting it to gas or getting a nice electric insert. User 11: Big classic (gold) framed painting would be nice above the fireplace, perhaps a rug and some poofs. A basket of blankets? User 12: If you are to mount the TV on the fireplace, I would center it based on the whole width, and put something like a plant or vase on the floor beside the fireplace to compensate for it being off center.  That way, if you upgrade to a larger TV, there's no chance it will be too wide and extend past the brick on the left side.  You may also want to get a fake mantle to hide the cables too. User 13: Why is the fireplace not centered! User 14: Mount the tv User 15: in the fireplace. Yule log video FTW. User 16: I would mount the tv over the fireplace (offset), get an electric insert for it.  I would build a proper floor to ceiling shelf next to it. The whole wall seems off because of the tv cabinet. User 17: This is a good idea too! User 18: Lots of great ideas here, [[URL]  I would cover the fireplace with [slate tile]([URL] [concrete-looking tile]([URL] or, for a lighter look, a [straited marble style]([URL] (The [straight tile look]([URL] is not my personal favorite, but it is very good with your house style.) I would also make the opening flush, as the sample photos are, and/or add a gas, gel, or electric insert. (I woudl also pull off the half-round wood moulding, which looks cheap and see if you do without or add a bullnose tile in a complimentary style to what you have on the hearth.  Then, think of one wide floating shelf in a dark wood tone like walnut.  In the [last photo]([URL] I also like how they built a bookcase with doors. This might work well for you, too and you can design it to leave it open to watch TV or hide it away.  Looks like a great project—post updates!  P.S. If you like the [look of the logs in this photo]([URL] you could think about relocating the lights itch, building a cubby floor-to-ceiling, and putting decorative logs in there. It woudl be very dramatic.  UPDATE: Just found [THIS one—would be a fabulous look for you]([URL] User 19: Mount the tv! User 20: Moubt a TV over it and put a bookshelf to the side where the fireplace is uneven. You can use it for games and more, the bookshelf. User 21: You could mount it, centered on the actual hearth; and maybe put three small picture frames vertically on the right side. User 22: Move the planter next to the TV onto the floor to the right of the fireplace. I think a mantel shelf the whole length of the brick would look nice. Add some candles, plants or nicknacks. I’d add an interesting huge clock or mirror above the mantle. User 23: Using it as a mini gallery space would be cool. You could play a lot of colour off of that deep grey background.     Don't cover it up too much though, it's gorgeous! User 17: We also have a mid century modern home like you with a working but not used fireplace. We live in Florida, who needs a fireplace, it gets cold three days out of the year.   What my artist wife did was put led lights with a big Boulder with a bed of rock at the bottom and a few decorative sticks. She gets compliments on it all the time. Our TV is to the left and we have left the area above the fireplace blank like you have yours. However, in your case you would want to figure out how to properly hide the electrical wires and mount a larger TV centered and at a comfortable height for viewing.   A friend of ours with a similar home capped their fireplace inside and out and turned it into a home for their ball python. Has special lighting and terrain (branches and rocks) for the snake to hide in and climb around on.   Sketch out a few ideas and post again. User 24: I think the drab color is what's turning me off. It's A LOT of gray in your face.  A thick wood mantle of some kind would let you put up some softer or colorful peices to break it up. I like someone else's idea of a round mirror perhaps. Some birch logs arranged on a proper fireplace grate would look nice, maybe with a candle then flanking each side. User 25: You could install a ventless gas fireplace if you wanted the ambiance.    I wouldn’t go the TV route unless you have to have the space for a TV.   As mentioned above, a nice wood mantle would look good…you could do a sculptural art piece above. User 26: Well the color is bad the fireplace should've been in the middle  as far the tv goes my sister has hers above the fireplace and wall sconces on the side looks really nice. User 27: Floating shelves, photos in a nice pattern, plants, big mirror, I could continue bc there are so many options!! User 28: I would get a frame TV and hang it over the fireplace looking like a a framed painting User 29: These faux logs are what we have in our fireplace. It sits on the metal thing you put logs on. Then you inserts tea lights. We have ours on a remote. If you wanted to, you could add a screen infront. I'd also add a tall plant to the right of the fireplace.

User 1: It looks like sanitizer or alcohol damage, the damage is permanent but you can minimize the visibility of it by applying some coconut oil or Vaseline to the area. User 2: With the pandemic these alcohol/sanitizer damage posts are on the rise. I feel really bad for people because you can’t fix it, and LV won’t replace it. User 3: I ruined a purse from colored hand sanitizer. It’s been like a year & im still annoyed. Colored hand sanitizer is super risky for purses. :( User 4: Yeah, I got a drop on one of my handles and it’s still there. I actually shed a tear or two 😩 User 2: Awe!!! Is it a leather handle? They can replace that if it is! If it continues to bother you. User 4: It’s a tiny spot, but I’ll have to look into it. User 5: This is why I keep my hand sanitizer in a make-up bag inside my bag. It's a good idea for keeping the inside of a bag cleaner and free of mess. I learned this the hard way when a lipstick tube melted inside my LV pouchette. OP: I’m screaming crying throwing up :( User 2: You could always consider sending it to an artist to have them paint a design on it…? I’ve seen people get their pet, or a cartoon, or flowers etc. just something to consider for saving it? There are a bunch on instagram that are really cool. User 6: Happened to my LV wallet. Doesn’t bother me much though but oil helps a bit. User 7: Have you been using hand sanitizer and touching it afterwards? Unfortunately it’s not going to come off as it’s damage to the canvas. User 8: Yeh no that’s not coming off sadly User 9: Oh, no. Unfortunately, that looks pretty permanent. I’d take it to a cobbler. User 10: You know there are businesses that specialize in restoring bags, I’m sure you could get it fixed User 11: I think it is the canvas coating rubbing off? If you bought directly from LV, take to boutique. User 12: Yes! Take it to the boutique, they do repairs. I lovingly stained my LV bag that was a white epi leather and they repaired it for $180AUD. A lot cheaper then I expected! User 13: Send photos to Rago Brothers they do phenomenal restoration work on all leather and canvas- New Jersey or NY I believe, gl!! User 14: Oh no crying for you 😭 this actually looks a bit like my wood flooring which got a bit stained from spraying alcohol and not wiping up immediately (white marks). You need to act fast (not let it sit for days) to try and get rid of. What I did was wet it and then wipe with a wet towel with some dish detergent. After some rubbing I was actually able to get it off the wood flooring. Obviously this is canvas and not wood and any harsh products are frowned upon but if you want to try pls do so at your discretion! 😭 maybe you can try a little bit at one of the areas and then quickly wipe dry if seeing no progress? Good luck my friend\n",

            "User 77 - qktsa8 Original Post: I'm moving into this apartment soon. It will have a dark gray sofa and a cement/black TV stand that sorta of matches the wall/window trim. I'm trying to figure out how to add a little color to it all. The kitchen does have an orange backsplash. Image: a room that has lots of windows in it. User 1: Plants, with all those windows. User 2: That’s a nice apartment you have there. I would add orange, and a secondary color like yellow or green to pillows, vases, art work, and a blanket. OP: Any ideas on a rug color? Originally I was going to get a tan leather sofa and had all my ideas based around that, then I decided to save a little money and just go with a fabric sofa. I was thinking about getting an orange/terracota colored throw for the sofa. Then natural oak or terracota bases for some plants.    Is there a way to add multiple photos to the original post? It would only let me add one picture. User 3: Since you don't have a lot of wall space for art, I'd suggest getting a patterned rug - something like a kilim rug with terracotta as one of the colours in it would give you visual interest, pattern and colour.   That's a great apartment, by the way! OP: Unique Loom Autumn Collection Checkered Abstract Casual Warm Toned Area Rug, 5 x 8 ft, Multi/Dark Brown [URL]  I was considering this rug. It's a little on the cheap side but I still think it looks nice.   And I did buy some burnt orange pillows for the sofa with a beige throw User 4: I would go for something with more organic shapes since everything else in the apartment is already pretty boxy. You'll notice that interior designers for industrial lofts use a lot of oriental or southwestern rugs to warm up what can otherwise be pretty visually cold spaces  Maybe something like this? [URL] User 5: I think the colors of the rug are nice, but the pattern might be a little too choppy and too many squares. I think something more like this would look nice: [URL] User 6: I have a tan (leather) sofa and burnt orange throw pillows, but a rich blue rug really sets it off. Or the rug you chose with blue velvet pillows or a throw.  Blue and dark orange really play well with each other. User 7: I'm in love with this. I agree, lean into the orange and add warm colours and plants and floral prints if you like them. OP: Here are some additional photos as well to give an idea of the rest of the main area. Also, would you guys suggest putting the tv against the only drywall area as long as it fits with the barndoor? Originally I wanted to put it in front of the window, but now that they took the plastic off the windows and I get this clocktower view, I'm not sure I want to block that.  [URL]  [URL]  [URL] User 8: Yes, I believe the TV stand needs to go where the barn door is (maybe pulled out 6” so as not to get hit - too bad it’s not a regular swinging door). If the tv goes anywhere else, it could get wet. OP: The clearance from the wall to the edge of the opened door is actually about 70 inches. So I can still fit something there and it not get hit, as for the tv getting wet, honestly I just planned to never open those two windows. User 9: Art work, pillows, and an area rug would bring in some color.  Here are a few area rug suggestions:  1.) [URL]  2.) [URL]  3.) [URL]  4.) [URL]  5.)

User 1: The torn and bloody banners of your defeated enemies alongside their bleached skulls, tastefully transformed into decorative goblets. User 2: I'm obviously late here, but glad I made it in time to upvote this comment. User 3: Lean various sizes of black and white framed art User 4: One large picture with a bright color scheme. Then get an area rug with a similar color in it for the ground. It’ll liven things up a bit. OP: I was thinking of commissioning my sister to make a 3 piece canvas User 4: That would work. I’d probably try to find a rug with a color you like in it, then try to get her to use that color in the painting. It might be difficult to match a rug to a custom painting if you do the painting first. User 5: can i interest you in a financially crippling Funko POP collection ? User 5: One mega sound-bar :D User 6: what media stand is that ? OP: I forget specifically the name of it, but I bought it from Wayfair User 7: How do you like the quality? Is it particular board similar to ikea? Is it shiny or matte?   Thanks! OP: Quality I would say is a little better than IKEA - it is glossy on the outside. I know in looking at reviews, multiple people had issues with damaged parts. Mine did have damage too, but thankfully it was internal where you can't tell User 8: Real plants or fake? OP: Only the big palm is real User 9: The best thing to add in that area would be your collections, you can add your books, action figures, small photo frames by the way on the side you might be interested in adding some multi-panel on the side like this [one]([URL] or a three panel like [here]([URL]  By the way you've got a good choice of lamp. User 10: Id say books and random cool stuff like smaller succulents and vinyl toys. Random decor.  Larger art would be distracting imo right above the TV. User 11: Vinyl toys are tacky as hell. Steer clear, OP. User 10: If you have tacky tastes, you'd buy tacky vinyl toys. Lol. User 5: I think I’d put four or five wooden giraffes of various sizes 🦒 on the shelf. User 12: Some books and random art pieces User 13: Another TV /s User 14: Is this pic taken from where you sit when watching tv? OP: [URL] not quite User 15: So I agree with most others that a large piece of art with color that matches a carpet would probably be best.  I am however a little perplexed by your current setup. Is the chair blocking a doorway? Is there enough space to get around the chair and end table? It's probably just the angle of the photo but this makes them look like they are completely in the way. If they are, then moving the chair closer to the corner and rotating it towards the couch might be the better spot for it.  Also, if this were my space, I would re-align the tv/shelf to be centred with the V of the ceiling. Right now the symmetry of the room seems off. It would also make watching tv from the couch a lot more enjoyable since it would align better to it. Obviously, if you did this than you would flip the plant to the other side. User 16: I see you haven't paid the cat tax. User 17: Your bong collection! User 18: Question: do those plants get enough light? My living room is similar to yours and is pretty dark so all the plants I put back there eventually need to be moved into a more sunny location OP: The large majesty palm is the only real plant. I have only had it for about a week, so I haven't had much time to gauge that yet User 19: Vinyl Records mix and matched User 20: What type of plant is the big one? And where did you get it. Love it. OP: Majesty palm from Lowes User 21: Pictures, little knock knacks and plants! User 22: What color paint is that? OP: Repose gray by Sherwin Williams User 23: Childhood sports trophies OP: How could I forget! User 24: something with color ffs...  and for the height of the room the tv is too low. User 25: I know this doesn't answer the question you asked, but I think you should consider raising the TV up. From your other picture posted it looks like the TV is really low in relation to the couch. I would raise it up so the middle of the TV is at or around eye level, then reposition the shelf to match. That change alone will dictate what you put on it because of the height restriction. OP: I have a low-sitting IKEA karlstad which is actually pretty level with the TV, otherwise yeah I definitely would raise the TV if it wasn't level\n",

OP: That was my first choice as well but when we got it quoted it didn’t fit our budget 😢 User 2: Is it something you can save for? And just get a nice big rug for now?   Otherwise I’d go dark and dramatic. Dark dark gray or black - and it could handle a fun pattern. Long tiles in an ashlar pattern or even a slate herringbone situation (pattern running perpendicular to hardwoods). User 1: Maybe you could get a wood laminate that has a design like this do it doesn't look out of place with the rest if the floor.  [URL] User 3: A green or blue slate tile would bring a nice deep, earth toned color that the space desperately needs. User 4: I think a long dark colored tile or vinyl laminate like charcoal would look awesome here. I think a light color would make the space look too sterile User 5: I think a taupe colour would tie it all in. The warm wood and grey from the cabinets. I like a neutral base that you can accentuate with colourful touches if you like, than can be easily moved. For a flooring I think something like the ivory colour of this tile would suit: [URL] User 6: I think you need color or drama. The white on white on white look is dying. Play with adding some color with some decorative tiling. Or drama with darker tile/lvp like a gray or even black. User 7: A nice clean, slate gray colored tile would look good!

User 1: Start adding decorations that are copper colored and more greens that are your bed cover or pair well with it. OP: Love this idea, thank you! User 1: Mabey stick with a theme too? Your bed is fern-sy/woodsy? So decor that leans that way with coordinating colors? If you can paint or wall paper take one wall, find a light background and mimic or resemble the blanket pattern? I'm sure there's some string lights out there that are set far enough apart/with thin enough wire to look like fireflys on said mural/wall paper? Spit balling here OP: I was thinking of finding a darker rug, adding decals to the closet doors and adding art to the wall but not sure about how to keep it from being too much with the wall colour being white and the dark floors User 2: Mirrors and framed art! User 3: Yes...and plants. User 4: Your bedding and that picture are really gorgeous 😍😍 please put it up it'll look glorious.  I'm thinking natural/brown sheepskin rug to go with that green velvet bedspread, and maybe some faux ivy over the  curtains & curtain rail  The white is a good base but it's quite a cold sterile white - there are softer gentler shades you could look into.  I'd also replace the white bedside cabinet with something wooden and maybe rattan as well for texture. OP: Good ideas and thank you for this, I love the idea of the natural rug! I agree with you about the white too User 5: Add a plant! I have added plants to my room and they have added so much life. User 6: Definitely add golden yellow and mauvelous pink furniture or decorations to contrast the green bed-set. OP: Oooh great call on the mauve, I love that contrast! Thank you! User 7: I would add more deep green/emerald paintings or tints of copper or deep purple decor. Maybe some plants and more greenery if thats the theme you want to stick to. OP: Thank you!! User 8: I love the green 🌿 OP: Thank you! ❤️ User 8: A mirror on your closet would reflect the light and help the room feel bigger. You can also paint the backwall with an accent color and that will make it appear longer. OP: Thanks! I agree, the closet is a bit tricky to put actual mirroring onto, but adding some illusion of depth there I think could be lovely… appreciate your ideas here, thanks!!

User 2: You can put [colorful tree painting]([URL] (4 panels) or one of these [green leaves or quotes paintings]([URL]   ***Good luck!!*** User 3: This person is clearly a shill for that website based on their post history. Neither of their recommendations match your space.    You could do a large photo ledge (if you can find a few studs in the wall to mount it to so that it's secure) [which is neat because you can easily swap out the art/photos as you feel.]([URL])    [A big round silver mirror would also look nice!]([URL])      I know you didn't ask this - but swapping the navy sheets for some nice crisp white bed linen would help tie your space together.You can keep the colour in the throw pillows if you like it as an accent colour, or get a navy duvet (see photo above for grey/navy bed) but it's too dark for a full sheet set. I would also consider swapping the navy sheer curtains for something lighter in colour. OP: BTW I somehow missed that photo ledge, which I actually really love the idea of. I’m going to look into building! And PS I also hated those first suggestions hahaha. Thank you for confirming that. OP: They are actually black and I now have a black comforter as well. The sheer curtains are also black. I love super modern and I love the black and white contrast. I actually modeled my room exactly after a modern room that I really liked with black accents. But, you make good points! I will try white sometime and see how I like it! Thank you! User 4: I'd do black and white photography. OP: oooh i like that idea, maybe a few big prints User 4: Yes you could do two 8x10's mounted in big white mats with thin black frames. User 3: Ah I see! Interesting how different colours can look on computer monitors. Maybe try a white blanket instead of grey to provide more contrast with the black sheets? It just seems a bit unbalanced currently.

OP: Actually this may he a good idea thanks User 1: You're welcome, it's not a failed wall it's just a half wall seeking a bottom :P User 3: This is a great idea! Visual interest beyond the wood, plus plants! OP: My issue is this design fell twice, I need an alternative User 1: Oh, then planters affixed to it would probably help a lot.  Wind will blow many things over unless they are weighted. OP: I didnt even realize that, thanks User 1: You're welcome User 4: I would also space the slats out a litter further. They won’t be as opaque, but they’d let the wind through more. User 5: 😂 User 6: I love this!!!! User 1: Yay! User 7: It’s not failed .., continue the same strips to the bottom and clean up the sides … run a saw up and zip the irregular edges off . I think it looks cool … if you want to spice it up more get some vines planted on the ground and run them up the wall User 8: The FAIL is that it fell over 2x according to OP.  The planter idea everyone gave is a great idea and would look beautiful.  For the time being until you can get something going, you might try to anchor it into that grass behind, or add 2 diagonal supports to the back.  It wouldn't be eye pleasing but would support the structure until you can give it some bottom weight with planters or some other support.  If you own the property you could also anchor it into the patio with metal post anchors. OP: The patio is pebble aggregate,is it easy to anchor to? I'm a bit scared of doing it User 8: Hmm, that one I'm not sure on. You could pound a wooden stake into the ground and bolt it to that. It might not work long term but until you can figure something else out it would probably stabilize as I'm not sure about the pebble aggregate.  You could also just remove the stabilizers you currently have and actually sink the posts into the ground with cement. It would then not even be on the actual porch but just beside it. User 9: Planters and put in vines that you can train up the wall a bit. Makes it so pretty. User 10: Put some sand bags on the feet. Four on each leg, 50lbs each should work. User 11: If you affix large planters at the bottom put a cement block in each to keep it stable then add your dirt. User 12: I actually think it's really pretty, even if its not conventional or whatevs seemingly wrong w it:P. I was gonna say pots or planters w climbing vine plants to go on the walls. Everyone's thinking the same thing lol OP: Thanks, the stability of this thing is questionable, fallen twice now, im.going to do the planter in front idea User 13: Can you dig a hole for each post and fill it with QuickCrete? OP: That was an idea but the area behind it is turf and I don't want to dig a hole in the turf User 7: The have these sheets of rolled “privacy screen” that attach onto fences. You could throw it on an call it a day.    Inexpensive fix. Amazon has a lot of selections. I had one before that looked like ivy. They’ve got bamboo and all kind of colors User 14: Put some vines on that wall User 6: I actually love this a lot, especially with the suggestion of some planters to block out the bottom. What did you do to make this/did you have anything online you found so I could replicate this summer? OP: Thanks, I'll redo it in a better way. I used this video   [URL] User 15: Use the rectangle planters and maybe paint this. A dark green will blend with your surroundings. User 16: I say add a rose bush or a vine bush that drapes down. Unsure on if there's a better term/word for it but they sit/grow on a thin wooden board or a metal board and it does create privacy but also beauty. OP: Thanks I'm trying to grow stuff but It has to be grown in pots User 17: If you want to keep it from falling maybe stick the vertical wood in two planters with concrete inside? If you really wanted to be sure you could then bury it User 18: Would bamboo pots in front of it do? I heard they are great for cover walls. 3 jumbo pots- buy them tall (matured ?) from nursery.  Good luck op User 19: Morning glories and moon flowers planted together.

            "User 83 - ifoqxl Original Post: help me pick an accent wall color plz Image: a living room with a tv and a bunch of furniture. User 1: There's already a LOT of color here. I wouldn't bother with an accent wall. User 2: I wouldn't do an accent wall. If you aren't happy with the amount of color, I would probably just paint the entire room in a subtle color (something that won't pull away from the boldness of the color that's already there, but won't be so..... white) User 3: A subtle yellow/gold would be nice. User 4: On the wall with the windows in. Or red! The red from the painting! User 5: It looks like you have space above the couch for a large art piece? Is go that way. I LOVE color and you have so many nice, rich colors in this room. I think you’re going to lose the depth of them if you paint the walls a color. The White helps them pop and feel saturated. I would keep the walls white! OP: this is exactly why i was having such a hard time! thank you User 5: I guess if you really want a wall color, don’t do it solid! Get a stencil with a pattern that will leave the majority or the wall white but the stencil design will be color. That could be cool and keep it from flooding the room. It would have to be a simple design so it doesn’t  over complicate the room! User 6: Which wall are you going to paint? User 7: If you insist on it - The windowed wall in the same gold as the sofa. User 8: I’d say the window wall in a very soft pink. User 9: I am usually all for bright colors and accent walls and normally white walls bore me intensely but.... this looks really great exactly how it is. User 10: This looks great, not sure an accent wall would improve it. That said, you could do that gold/mustard on the wall with the windows. User 11: I don't think mustard would look good with the amber light wood floors. Kinda like when I try to wear dark yellow clothing, it's a weird peach & mustard hell. Someone suggested a jewel tone red, I think that might be better. I also like the purple in the lower right corner of the painting. User 10: I like the purple idea OP: i originally thought to do a deep purple User 12: I third a nice dark deep purple, goes well with the rest of the jewel tones present in the room already User 13: If it wasn't for your baseboards and the AC unit, I would paint all the walls teal like the chair and curtains.   Also I'd move the teal art above the sofa, and double-triple- up your curtains to make them a lot fuller, extending the rods so the curtains stack back on the wall not the window. I'd do this regardless of what color you paint the walls. User 14: What about instead of an accent wall you did a simple but large shape? Like a big yellow circle or a triangle - but off center and geometric so it looks intentional but funky? OP: i like this idea! User 14: My friend’s been doing it to [her house. ]([URL] I’m not bold enough to do it in mine, but I think it looks cool. OP: oh that’s fantastic! User 15: That looks awesome! User 15: Yessss do this! Behind the TV that corner, a big mustard/deep yellow circle going over both walls would look amazing User 9: Yeah this is good! User 16: Yess do this!  I am picturing violet, though.  Like a bright, balanced purple.  Might be a little off beat but honestly that seems like your style. OP: purple was my first mind! User 17: I think I would do a deep purple on the window wall. Maybe do a big triangle from the bottom corners of the room and have the point at the top of the room in between the windows? That would look really neat! User 18: Do a nice dark green or greenish blue. User 19: I agree with u/keiwei66 about the pink, something like [Farrow and Ball Cinder Rose]([URL] I think with such a neutral kind of pink you could probably do either of the longer walls this colour User 20: I second the person who said pink, but I’d go soft coral. Love your sofa. User 21: I would do a wine/blood red! If you have this much color going on, lean in to it and go for all the jewel tones! User 22: I think you have enough color and it looks nice as it User 23: Maybe a patterned wall on the wall the gold couch is on. I could see a nice pastel brown/yellow/gold working there. With maybe some geometric lines. User 24: Paint at least the window wall bright white— the eggshell isn’t letting those colors pop as much as they can. User 25: Use the same color family as the chair and curtains.  From the photo, I can't tell if they are green or teal.  You could do couch pillows in a similar shade of chair or curtains, and/or a lighter shade as an accent wall.  Whatever you pick, I recommend you get a sample and paint some to confirm.  Colors always seem lighter or darker than the paint chip. User 26: I think all the walls could use color, and that the window wall should be a different color than the others, but NOT any deep tones the way a typical accent wall would be, unless you plan on changing the curtains to something lighter.   I wonder how it would look with the window wall in a waaay desaturated gold like [BM Hay Stack]([URL] and the others with a way desaturated teal like BM [San Celemente Teal]([URL]  I do like the idea of adding texture/pattern to the walls rather than just color if that sparks your interest at all. User 27: I would choose the window wall and do three shades of coral/orange in a bold, large scale geometric shape. Use painters tape to make a white line in between the three colors: [URL] OP: ooooohhh that’s nice! User 28: Really nice! :D User 29: I don't think you need an accent wall. You've put a lot of vibrant, complimentary colors in the room already. User 18: The color of the chair and curtains! I think that would look really pretty. User 30: White is a classic. User 31: I love your sofa! Could you please share where you got it? OP: thank you! i got it from floydhome.com User 31: Thank you! I'd never heard of this company before. User 32: Wow, your decor is about the same colors as mine, lol. I have that same chair in yellow and my couch is blue with red flowers. Even the curtains are that color, but velvet. I also have an outstanding color painting that was used as an inspiration for various colors. Coffee table is red leather, large blue oriental rug.    My walls are an olive green and looks great with it all:  [[URL] OP: nice! my curtains are velvet too! lol thank you, i like that color User 33: If anything I'd go [grey]([URL] and try to make it more [cohesive]([URL] User 34: You could do slate grey if you wanted but I honestly like it white User 35: I would do a light grey on the wall where the desk is.

Image: a television and a couch in a room with a hard wood floor. User 1: Start off with just sofa and a coffee table - you can add more later. And you have enough room that you can keep the loveseat if you think it’s comfy.   The type of sofa depends on your budget and your style - I love the vintage look you’ve got going on already, and a thrifted coffee table would do nicely, but I wouldn’t suggest a secondhand sofa. The good news is you’ve got some room so you can get almost anything that takes your fancy! Personally I think a three seater will give you more long-term flexibility than a sectional, but I guess sectionals are popular for a reason.   Have you considered painting the two wood sidetables that are up against the far wall? I think they could look pretty great painted in two colours with the trim picked out - maybe take a couple of colours from the posters on your wall, like two different shades of orange or yellow, and use one for the body and one for the trim. It’s a pretty bold move, though, so your mileage may vary on that one!   It’s a great space for a first home - have fun with it! OP: Thanks for the advice! As far as budget, within reason I’m pretty flexible. The loveseat is just a bit awkward, as it really only seats one when it comes to having friends over… it’s a little too close for comfort for anything other than a couple, but it takes up a lot of space.   Ideally I’d love to have a nice leather chair in front of the record player, but to have it spaced out with enough seating for other people I’m not sure that would work ☹️ User 1: Ah well in that case I would get rid of the love seat as soon as you can. A leather chair by the record player would look great! And there would be plenty of room if you replace the loveseat with a normal (not oversized) sofa.   You could get some Kraft paper, have a look on the IKEA website, and map out what space the furniture would take up in your room before buying. (You don’t have to buy IKEA, but that would at least give you typical furniture sizes so you can map things out before browsing.) User 2: I've purchased a 'used sofa' from Habitat for Humanity Restore that was and is a great piece in our home.  We have the matching chair, as well. Both pieces are comfy and look great.  Got them for around $300 CAD (or under $240 UDS.) We keeping popping back there, looking for another chair that will work with our 'set'. User 3: If you're a gamer, keep the loveseat as a lounger just so your lovers can join when inspired. Let me know how it goes, I'd love that as a gamer partner. OP: I’d love any advice on how to best layout the large wall of my living room, too. My guitar and stool are just kind of there, temporarily. Anything can be moved or repositioned.  I’m 22 and this is my first house. I’m a bit overwhelmed trying to decorate an entire house myself, if I’m being honest. User 4: I think you have too many small things on one wall. It makes it look cluttered. I would buy a longer tv stand and center it on that wall. I like the guitar. I would hang it on the wall to the right of the tv stand. I would see if the other piece with the record player would fit under the window. Put your records next to it. I would take the stool out of the room. Put a big plant on the left of the tv stand. Buy a couch and put it across from the tv stand. You can see if there’s room for a small chair to the left of the couch kinda angled User 5: Btw, super cool to have your first home at 22! Bravo! User 6: I googled “rock and roll living room” and found lots of cool ideas for you. Also looking up “rock and roll vintage decor” Find your style, use what you’ve got. Hang your guitar on the Wall. Get a cool floor light, consider painting the walls dark (but not black!) User 6: Display your records on the wall for instant art  [URL] User 5: If you don’t want to spend any money this is what you do; push the sofa back and toward the centre of the carpet and so it’s almost at the edge of the carpet; put the tv on top of the other cabinet and centre it in front of the repositioned sofa; now move the freed up cabinet under the window with the sound system on it and centre it; move the table on the side of the sofa to the other side of the sofa; put the stool in the corner with the guitar and amp so it’s in a triangle formation with the stool being in the corner and the others on either side; keep the magazine rack on the side of the new tv cabinet in a similar location to where it currently is, but do not push it up against the cabinet as much as it currently is. I think that’s all User 7: Prioritize getting a chair or 2 or a larger sofa, depending on how much you like to entertain. A coffee table or end table is also always helpful for setting down a drink, or placing an extra lamp.  Next can I make a suggestion? You should put the turn table under the window, by a longer console for the tv and create a gallery wally around the tv using your current art plus adding more pieces. Everything on the wall looks like its floating. Your tv sticks out, and it looks almost too big for the table it's sitting on.  I would also mount the guitar on the wall with a hook or something so you can take it down to use it. OP: Hey, thanks for the advice.   I do see where you’re coming from on the record player, but for a few reasons I can’t make that work…  I do agree I need to prioritize furniture. I’ve been having a really hard time figuring out what is best for the space User 5: Are the reasons sun damage or electrical port? OP: Well, having my setup near the window is one reason. Wouldn’t feel great about that haha.  but mostly, I love how it turned out with my original Thin Lizzy poster / now playing record stand. I’d like to keep that intact even if everything else gets swapped out. Every time I walk into my house I think it looks awesome.  I bought a new black leather couch today so hopefully that’ll be a nice addition User 8: Put that tv on the wall as well! User 9: I like the idea of going with the rock and roll/ vintage theme. Seems like you have a lot of red, black and purple so it might be nice if you got a big cozy red or black couch to fit the colors and full up the space in the middle. Also nice colorful led lighting also helps give a room more personality and color and would help with that old school rock and roll theme. They have some good ones online. Also getting a coffee or end table for snacks or a drink would be convenient and help fill it up. But I bet you could find some good stuff to fit your theme at some thrift or antique stores.

            "User 86 - t2nj2a Original Post: What color floors? I want darker but afraid it will clash with the light cabinetry Image: a kitchen with a metallic refrigerator freezer and a dishwasher. User 1: I think slate tiles would look really nice here. Darker floors will help ground the space nicely. OP: I'm hoping so.. not a big fan of light floor or floor matching cabinetry. Thank you!! User 2: I have the light maple cabinets with dark flooring and I do not like it. As maple ages, it tends to get more yellow. I will probably be painting my cabinets light gray or white because I think they clash with the flooring. Whatever you do, don't be afraid to obtain samples that are large enough so you can really see how it will look together. OP: Very good to know, will definitely do that. Thank you!! User 3: A charcoal would go well - it’s match the oven glass User 4: I say this too.  I have this, but I have charcoal worktops so maybe it matches better.  I agree it would go with the oven though. OP: I was thinking charcoal, I was planning to carry through the living room (it's all open) and I have charcoal in there now which I love. Thank you! User 5: I think the existing flooring works well in here. I like your countertop, it's pretty!  I find it hard to believe that's a counter depth fridge: it juts out farther than the counter. What's on the other side of the kitchen? One option is to open up the wall there so you can bump the fridge back into the space behind, like if that area was a closet or something. OP: Thank you! :) unfortunately it's really junky so it has to go. It is definitely a counter depth fridge, just an extra small kitchen - it's a townhouse though and the other side is my neighbors house so can't really do anything with it :/ User 6: I'm actually in favor of the light floor color here, because you pointed out that your kitchen is small, so I don't think it needs more contrast. The flooring you have is very unobtrusive.  I'd make an exception for a slate tile that blends beiges and gray tones, though. OP: Very good point, thank you!! User 7: I think a color on the floor would brighten the room. Maybe a pale blue tile.  His is a normal sized fridge, I have one similar. My old fridge was larger and had 2 doors with a large pull out freezer. Miss it! Sold it with the house. User 8: You say clash, I say contrast. Go for dark walnut OP: Yay!! User 9: Clashing aside, I have kitchen floors in a “Espresso” color, it’s a nightmare to keep clean. I’d stay with what you have or similar to what you have. User 10: I really love your cabinets.  Do you know where they’re from?  I think the suggestions about slate or charcoal are good.  I have porcelain tile in my kitchen, with a kind of marble pattern.  The colors are shades of grey, but there’s an ocher vein that goes through it that would be picked up by those cabinets. User 11: dark floors are hell to keep clean, especially in a kitchen User 12: Your cabinets are nice but don’t pop at all. What if you did black hardware to match a darker floor  [URL] User 13: agreed that black, modern hardware will help a ton here.   I vote keep the floors light or medium brown. and if you can spring for a white countertop to really freshen up the place.   search \"light cabinets kitchen\" on Pinterest. I'm feeling too lazy to link a pic haha. User 14: Actually contrasting dark and light is popular. I think a great tone or slate would be ok User 15: I would consider getting a nice rug from Ruggable[ruggable]([URL] They can be washed in the washer so great for kitchens. I am so so happy with mine. I wasn’t ready to do big work on my kitchen but was sick of the blah floor. It’s a great option. OP: Ahh thank you for the tip!! Was considering getting one for the living room since I don't see my current white rug holding up forever lol. Glad to hear you're happy with yours! User 16: This is the advice they need most, good job.  I could not place the answer User 17: You didn't ask, but that fridge is in the wrong place. You should move that monstrosity to the edge of the room where the dishwasher currently resides. OP: If y'all don't stop picking on my fridge.. 😂😂 User 18: Man, that fridge needs to be moved and the kitchen reconfigured. OP: 😐 User 12: 😂 User 19: Gray wooden flooring. User 20: I’d go darker, just choose a color of your liking…   Maroon or a darker turquoise is the route I’d try 😊 nice kitchen! User 21: That fridge is gigantic.  What do You Have in there lol User 22: Deep gray would look great there.  Just pick a dark one with a similar undertone to the stainless steel. User 23: It is the countertop that you should worry about. The cabinets will be fine. My cabinets are antique white, and my floors are charcoal. I get away with this because my countertop has dark veins running through it. Ties it all together. User 24: The cabinets need an update. A coat of paint and new hardware. The floors can be any color you like! User 25: Keep the floor, paint the cabinets User 26: Not sure about the floor, but i think softer overhead lighting would look nice and help with the overall tone in the room!! User 27: Weird suggestion here, but white appliances instead of floor change? I know they are technically passé right now but the cool stainless and warm cabinets are saying two different things. Otherwise I'd say a warm toned wood or laminate floor. User 16: Can we…can we paint the cabinets?  I love you but they’re so boring.\n",
            "User 87 - wnobep Original Post: What top would go well with these shorts? F19 Image: a girls shorts with orange and blue flowers on white. User 1: Orange or turquoise User 2: I think orange crop top would be cute ☺️ User 3: A flouncy, one-shoulder top in either orange or tan would look super cute with it. User 4: Orange crop top User 5: Black User 6: for where i like, id go with a cream fitted turtleneck. but like bright orange is definitely cute… if a bit strong for an everyday look. User 7: White tank bodysuit User 8: I'd pick one of the colors on the shorts, and match the top to it.  Orange makes me look sunburned so I'd go with the blue/ green. If you can pull off orange, than I'd go with that!\n",
            "User 88 - axbesx Original Post: My biggest concern is what would I place in the area's between the fireplace and the wall. Image: empty room with two windows, one fireplace, and two ceiling fans. OP: My initial thought was putting in bookcases. But the area is too large. Its much bigger in person.  User 1: I really like the book case idea and some friends built some a few years back but kept them lower and they looked great. I'd suggest looking around to see if anywhere fits your measurements to either buy prefab or consider building them yourself (or hiring a professional). Good luck! OP: Built in book cases may work. My wife wants doors on the bottom (we have young kids who love to tear things apart lol) But i think a custom built in would look nice. User 2: If you have young kids then built-in's with cabinets would be ideal as you could use them for toy storage. When they are older it could hold homework supplies and back packs. User 3: Try guilt in bookcases that are only 2 shelves high and include a bench top with a cushion. Extra seating for guests while filling the space in a pretty way. The windows are nice and tall, too.  OP: Oh this would open up some opportunities. I wouldnt have thought if either. Another good idea to run by the wife User 4: Yeah, built-ins for sure. You can do cabinets underneath with drawers or bins the kids can put their toys in on one side, use the other for A/V equipment running through the wall to the TV.  Above the cabinets you can do bench seating (if they’re low enough) or a couple of shelves to the height of the fireplace, and run one long mantle all the way across. I think white painted built ins with a stained wooden mantle, but it’s up to you! User 5: I would stick with custom built bookcases that *aren't* built in so you can move them later if you need the space for something else. We had built-ins installed and 6 months later we realized we didn't have a good place to put our Christmas tree User 6: book case but with some green? Or something that fills the wall but is a background. I liked the bistro idea of someone too User 7: I can see that. Bookshelves could really take over the room. I'd look for a pretty sideboard (or even dresser) that fits just right, and get two. Maybe put nice lamps on both. Then if it feels like too much space up above, you could add a floating shelf or two for plants or objets d'art, etc. Just gotta be careful not to let it get cluttered. User 8: What about matching wing chairs? It could frame in your sitting area around the tv. I'd keep them co-ordinated but not perfectly matching. [Here's an example]([URL] OP: I like this idea and never would have thought of that. I also like the plants and lights. Thank you for that insight, im gonna start looking at some chairs that may match our living room set. User 9: Yes, this idea! Perfect for some cozy chairs around the fireplace :-)  User 1: 2 50 inch TVS.  User 10: Listen to this person. Priorities.  User 11: Instead of putting book cases, I think putting wall to wall floating shelves would look more modern and would add some character to the space.  You can also add some pullout baskets underneath, or some cube Kaplan shelves from ikea with door or drawer inserts.  OP: So i took measurements and on both sides of the fireplace is 5'5\" inches and the fireplace is about 56 inches. So its a 65/56/65 split. Thank you all for your suggestions! We're probably gonna go with either the wingchairs or maybe a built in bench with a cabinet underneath and bookshelf on the side (depending on cost). User 12: That’s the perfect size for two 5’ reef tanks. Lol OP: I cant let my wife see this post or this us what she'll want to do! Lol. All i can imagine is cleaning two giant fish tanks lol User 12: His and hers tanks. No problem. Lol User 13: Can you make the windows bigger?  What is on the other side?  Nice view?? OP: Sadly no. The other side if that in particular would be my privacy fence lol. Otherwise this would be a great idea! User 14: Bigass speakers.  User 15: My man! User 1: I would put in a little bistro set on one side. Tea nook. The TV on the other side, leave some empty space along the nook side, and cozy up the TV side with a sofa and love seat or a sectional. User 16: The fan isn't central 😱 OP: Lol i was drawing some ideas up on the picture and i saw that too. It gave me Forrest Whitaker eye. Now i want to go back and measure the distance to both walls in the off chance that they were standing a little to the left when the pic was taken lol User 17: Looking at the shadows you definitely were a little to the left but I'm guessing the fan is still a a little off center, but who knows perspectives are weird. User 18: My parents have a set up like that! They put matching bookcases in the spaces then filled the shelves with decorative baskets (holding cat toys and hiding WiFi routers) and figurines. I’d probably add plants and books.  User 19: Built ins for sure. User 20: Giant speakers  User 21: Matching console tables with maybe some lamps and pretty plants/flowers? User 22: Curio shelves. Book shelves. Video game collection. Large plants with large wicker basket of fluffy through blankets. Your RC car collection.  User 23: Floating bookshelves under the window. Entire length of the wall, two to three rows, then 2 tower speakers/bookshelves on a stand. Amplifier on each far side of the wall powering the system.   Something like this for the speakers [Except have the amps off the floor.]([URL]) User 24: We have almost exactly the same set up and went with a bookshelf on each side. Gives the room a cozy study-like feel.  User 1: I’d do large bookshelves on both sides  User 25: Aquariums, terrariums, lit up plants (plant boxes). Anything that will require its own lights User 26: Subwoofers and floor standing so speakers. User 27: Floor plants? Maybe only on one side  User 28: If I didn't know any better this looks like the filming studio of Brad Hall the sneaker DON\n",
            "User 89 - lx4urg Original Post: [5ft] anyone have tips for styling wide leg pants? I absolutely love them but I feel like they can make me look even shorter. Image: a girl wearing an orange and white stripe sweater with ripped jeans and black boots. User 1: I love wide leg pants! I feel like they work better on me when I wear a solid colored pointed toe shoe because it kinda continues to lead the eye down and out. Bonus points if you match the color with the pants (black), the leg never ends! OP: Thanks! I gotta find a good pair of black wide leg pants User 2: I agree with the previous two comments, floor-skimming wide-leg pants are more flattering than cropped wide-leg pants. I have a couple and like you have a really hard time balancing the volume from the leg. It is especially challenging in colder months because in summer you can just pair them with a thin-strapped top. My best advice would be to pair them with a long sleeve bodysuit and if you need an additional layer, make sure it is cropped. OP: Ok thanks! I’ll try that, I’ve definitely been struggling with what to pair them with in the past couple of months User 3: I think this looks good! I’m 5ft too and when i wear wide leg trousers i wear them a little longer so they touch the top of my foot to make the lines longer! OP: Thank you! User 4: I personally avoid wearing anything chunky or oversized with wide-leg pants, because it can make me look like I’m wearing a larger person’s outfit. Streamlined, fitted, and delicate pieces usually make me feel more comfortable when I wear something oversized like wide leg pants, so that the pants look like an international statement piece rather than just being too big. OP: Thanks! That makes sense, I’ll give it a shot! User 5: I don’t think you look that short in the pic, I actually think the outfit suits you really well and looks very well proportioned.  I only have one pair of wide leg pants and they’re of a thinner material and lilac, so I don’t think they go well with clunky shoes (wore them with a winter boot doc marten and it was a mistake lmao), but I think those wide leg denims look great with a clunkier boot. And the tucked in shirt + belt is a good counter to the wide leg. I kind of think I have to copy this outfit?? User 6: This looks great! Great fit! Hope you’re having a great Thursday and thanks for sharing! User 7: This looks great! I second the comments suggesting something more fitted on top so it's a more streamlined fit. I usually wear some sort of heel when I wear wide legged pants (sock boots in the winter, heeled slides for spring/summer).\n",
            "User 90 - w4egt9 Original Post: [Update] Couch arrived and this is the rug I ended up choosing. Any coffee table and accent chair recommendations? Image: a blue couch with a chaise is on the floor. User 1: Something with a warm wood color would look nice. Check out antique shops or local furniture shops to find something that has some character and is made of solid wood. User 2: Yes, round or oval would look nice. OP: Getting cream and tan/brown throw pillows and blankets to match the rug.  And might get some help lifting the couch so I can slide the rug further up under the sofa.  Edit to Add: Just finished putting together the [TV Stand]([URL] I’m going to do something about that TV wire. Probably when I get the soundbar installed so the Geek Squad can do it all in one go. User 3: I suggest hold off in getting the throw and pillows until you have chosen the tables.  Choose the brown in the fabrics to coordinate with the wood instead of doing random brown color associations. User 4: I like the TV stand styling a lot, but i want it to be 50% bigger, both height and width. It looks weirdly tiny compared to your tv imo. Especially with your TV mounted that high. OP: My record player and speakers is actually going to be on the TV stand which is why I left a large-ish gap. Add some books or a couple of decor items, it should fill up nicely.  I’m also putting up shelves with the same wood tone on either side of it for additional storage/decor. I’ve used up most of the money I set aside for furnishing my first home with the essentials. So I’m buying pieces one at a time whenever I have extra cash after all the bills. User 5: You could also get throw pillows with a touch of teal   [[URL]  &#x200B;  [[URL]  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  [[URL]  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  [[URL] User 6: A coffee table with a cool walnut finish (looks like your sofa legs are this color) and a solid white marble top. Round or oblong would probably be the best shape given the L-shape of the sofa. User 7: I think a light brown leather arm chair would look amazing in this colour pallet. As well as a natural colour wood console table! Maybe some gold accents! User 8: UGH I LOVE EVERYTHING! Seriously you have such good taste, these are stunning. I can't get over the couch.   I'm picturing a mid century wooden coffee table that matches the wood of the legs of the couch. For the accent chair I'm really not sure, I'm picturing a cream chair of some sort, but as a parent to young children, the thought of something that light kind of freaks me out, so I feel like I can't recommend it... Definitely something more neutral because that couch is EVERYTHING OP: Thankfully, I do not have any kids or plan to have them in the near future. But I’m hoping to get a dog soon! User 5: With that couch you will save a lot of grief if you  can get a non-shedding dog.  A lot of breeds and mixes are non-shedding.  But if your heart dog sheds you will just have to vacuum the couch a lot . OP: I have allergies so hypoallergenic, non-shedding dogs are a must for me. I did test the sample of this on my brother’s yorkipoo (pretty much rubbed the sample all over her) and it did pretty well. I just hope Apt2B’s pet friendly labeling is accurate. User 4: I find smooth velvets like how that one looks are surprisingly easy to clean dog hair off of! Depends on the texture of your dog's hair though too. User 8: Yay doggo! I had dogs before I had kids so I know some stuff about dogs and design! My sister got these fancy blankets for her furniture that look like really nice faux fur throws, but are actually waterproof blankets for pets to protect your furniture. There might be other styles too. Or you could train your dog not to go on furniture lol, I've done it with big dogs, but don't have the heart to do it with little dogs (I like the snuggles too much!)   And there's now way more selection of aesthetic dog beds, so you can get one that fits in well in your design, especially if you get a big dog and not allow them on the furniture. I had both, dog beds everywhere and blankets on the couches for my doggo (elderly dachshund with a bad back, so she was only allowed on the couch if we lifted her on and off.) Worked great! User 9: Get a natural wood coffee table User 10: The style and color of the couch – winner! User 11: I would get an oval shaped wood table that matches the color of the sofa legs. Then I would get some cozy cream colored throw pillows so that the sofa ties in with the carpet :) User 12: [Something like this maybe?]([URL] OP: Thanks for the recommendation. It’s not really my style. I like clean lines but I’m thinking of something in that color way if it does not clash with my natural oak TV stand. User 13: I love that rug and i want it for my living room! Where did you get it? OP: Here’s the link: [Koko Geometric]([URL]  It’s still on sale! User 14: I love this, thank you! Is the dark color in it a navy or a black? OP: Navy User 15: Does it stretch out of shape when you walk on it or vacuum it? We’ve got a couple rugs like that that we wanna replace, because it drives me bonkers OP: I just got it yesterday so it still feels pretty stiff. I’ll see how well it holds up over time. User 16: I would move the rug a bit further under the carpet. User 17: Or maybe the rug should be turned the other direction so the long side is under the long side of the sectional. It's hard to tell without seeing the entire room. User 18: I was about to say the same. Also, then the rug pattern would be at right angles to the floor boards. OP: The rug is just the right size for the sofa. If I flip it to the other side, the legs on the sofa won’t reach the end. Definitely planning on pulling the rug further under the sofa though. It’s a two person job so I have to wait for a bit. User 19: Beautiful couch. Do you have a pic of the tv stand? OP: I just finished putting it together!  [TV Stand]([URL] User 20: What about something like [this]([URL]  Or   [this]([URL] User 21: You have warm, wooden tones in the legs and carpet. Mixing shapes creates a modern look that doesn't take up visual space, so I'd go for an oval or irregular brass table. Something along the lines of this...  [URL] User 22: I’d look for a coffee table wood grain. Same stain as the floor. User 23: I love the couch. Where did you get it? OP: Apt2B. It’s the Scott Sectional in the Peacock Green Performance Velvet fabric. It’s super comfy too! User 24: You have almost the same colors as our living room but in entirely different places.  I dig it! User 25: I loveee a velvet teal couch. Excellent choice. They pair well with brass decor, so because your couch is dark and solid and the rug is printed, I’d go with a round glass + brass table. Like two tiered for storage underneath. Even nesting style coffee table would look nice since you have a wider couch/space. Example: [URL]  For an accent chair I’d go with a tan cognac color pulled from the rug. A leather lounge chair would match the style with your couch :) Nothing too heavy, so having empty space under the seat would work best! Example: [URL] User 26: A thin brighter orange side table? User 27: I have a sort of guitar pick shaped acacia wood coffee table and I think it would look amazing here! I got mine from Homegoods, but I think any round-ish warm toned wood table would look great :) User 28: Very nice choices so far! User 29: If you can find a sick mid century curved coffee table you will have the room of my dreams User 30: I have this same rug and an extremely similar looking couch 😂 so I love your taste. I got this coffee table and it works really well. [URL] User 31: Glass round coffee table  Off while chairs with orange accent cushions and a huge plant User 32: I think an acrylic clear coffee table and a gray pouf for extra seating would be super cute here User 33: Bright yellow accents! User 34: This is an amazing rug - is there any chance you can rotate it? It's slightly too small for the couch this way. OP: If I rotate it, the legs won’t be on the carpet anymore. This was the biggest I could get. If I had gone for a 9x12 rug, I would cover up the vents on the floor.  Planning to pull the rug further under the sofa though. But it’s difficult to do on my own so need to wait until my brother is in town. User 34: Well either way the combo is :chef's kiss:\n",

I wear it everywhere and it’s such a good staple. Image: a black bag with the name prada is on a bed. User 1: I bought mine in 2010 and sold it in 2015 and I still regret letting it go 😭😭😭 OP: That’s where I’m at. I don’t want to sell it but I want another one. I feel like I would be empty without it OP: If you love the leather you should get a different Prada bag in the saffiano leather (which Prada invented btw) maybe the Double Bag? OP: I might just do that. This is the double bag. OP: The bag you posted looks like their classic Galleria Bag, possible the large? I can’t quite tell but the medium usually looks a little more square than rectangle. This is the Double Bag:  [URL]  They have a number of great light neutral colors and it should be a little lighter to carry than the galleria. OP: Ooohh okay. This is the medium galleria double bag! I think I want that bag you posted since it’s lighter OP: Yeah I have the Galleria in blue and as much as I love it, the weight definitely is a negative. I don’t have a double bag but I have held a few of my friends and they felt lighter! OP: That’s what I should get instead of the same bag! I appreciate your input User 2: I have also debated the same question with a Fendi bag but ultimately decided against it as I would like more variety in styles, especially since these bags are so pricey. I personally think the only bag I would get in multiple colors is the Chanel mini bag. OP: It’s a beautiful bag, timeless shape, size, color, silhouette. OP: Thank you! I feel I did a good investment with this bag User 3: Depends! Do you love the design, the leather finish, or the color? I don't think i'll ever own 2 of the same bag but in different color, i've done it with tshirts or jeans but not bags, but then again someone out there has neverfulls in all sizes and in monogram, DE and DA hahaha if it makes you happy, do it! OP: I think I’m in love that the leather I don’t need to worry about unlike my Gucci or ysl bags. I want something more everyday to wear with lighter colors. User 3: True! I love this bag too but never pulled the trigger to buy 1. I like their cammeo/orchidea color, i think they call it another name these days. OP: I understand! That’s the color I’m looking at. It’s like a tanish color. We will see if something else catches my eye by then. 😂 OP: Yes, get one!! I want a Prada so badly but I recently treated myself to a Givenchy Antigona (my dream bag when I was a teenager lol), and also a Kate Spade off their surprise sale and I can’t justify getting another bag anytime soon. 🙃 OP: My dream bag is a Antigona too. But I know they have strange issues with the leather which makes me think it’s not a good investment. I’m also scared that the base will bow. User 4: Ooooh I just got an Antigona after wanting one forever. They’re so classy! I keep watching IG for Prada deals too - I love the spectrum! User 5: What size double bag is it? Can you compare the size to neverfull? Most of my bags are black or tan- I think it totally makes sense to get both colors. OP: It’s a little smaller than a neverfull. I have one of those but I don’t like anyone can reach in there and can’t be a crossbody when I need it. I think the tan one will be a great choice since I wear this one all the time User 5: I agree about the closure. Which never full do you think, MM or GM? And is this the medium double? Thanks in advance OP: I’m sorry for the confusion. It’s smaller than the MM but the double is meaning it’s got two zipped compartments. Besides the middle where it’s open. It’s honestly I think the size of a PM but heavier User 5: Thank you!! User 6: Buy the tan for spring and summer and put this one away for next fall and winter. OP: You’re so smart thank you!!! User 7: Of course you need another one. Is the tan a warm tan, or more taupe? Taupe is awful, imo. i'll go look, maybe I need a lil something myself. 😇 OP: It’s more like a sandy tan. Taupe would be hard User 8: Gorgeous piece! Don’t let it go! Just get another one in a lighter color. Treat yourself, we’re living in a pandemic. You deserve that bag ❤️ OP: Thank you! I just got so many choices and it’s hard.\n",

Every other wall has something, the tv, large clock, small picture. I don't want to overdo it, but somehow, it seems like something is missing... Suggestions? Image: a living room with blue couch, white table and light colored rug. User 1: A small mirror? User 2: It won’t look so empty if you have a larger side table with a lamp or a plant on it OP: I would've liked a larger table as well but it's a small space right there and I can't fit anything bigger. Taller but not wider. OP: Larger as in longer? I think Iay see what you're getting at. Thank you User 3: Wrap a pothos up the pillar and swap out the short side table for a floating shelf with a lamp (tall but narrow). You can find square-shaped shelves out there, just be careful with height / elbows catching a corner. User 4: Maybe you can pull the end table forward a bit and put a tall thin plant in the corner? OP: That's a thought for sure. I have a small table lamp that turns on automatically for the dogs at night. I hate unsightly wires and the only plug on that wall is behind that small table. Ideally it would be behind the couch, but you know how that goes... so uts tough to figure this out User 5: I’d put the lighthouse on that wall and a large oversized piece of nautical art (or of an abandoned building lol ) on wall behind sofa.  As in, a large statement piece to fill most of the space. OP: Lol yeah...that's the fiances table book lol. She works with mental health patients and thought it was a cool book. She literally asked me, \"do you think that's super weird that I want this book?\" I said whatever floats your boat, I support you lol. It's her house too.  I appreciate the input, the lighthouse picture was a gift and fits the overall theme of the house (mostly) but it does seem to be too small for the space, I agree. Think I'm gonna have to find a new spot for it. It would barely fit on that small wall User 5: Lighthouse will fit the space if it’s not wider than the wall. There doesn’t have to be a border of wall surrounding it. User 6: I would maybe hang something bigger where the lighthouse is or put it to the side and put two smaller pieces up next to it like a gallery wall, and leave the wall with the pillar blank. I think it would be a nice thing to decorate like with a garland or lights for Christmas. User 7: I would leave it or put a floor lamp in the corner OP: I've thought about a floor lamp but I have a tray ceiling with lighting built in, as well as recessed lighting throughout the whole room. I really don't need any more lighting. I appreciate the input. User 8: Nice looking shelves that match the paint of the walls. It won't look empty and won't look like a decoration. User 9: The column is the decoration. User 10: Definitely wall mirror - vertical rectangular or oval shape would fit the space well. User 11: Portrait style art or even a light. A cool, manly light. Amazon has these crows with the bulb in it's feet or something like that.\n",
            "User 93 - dzba53 Original Post: Pretty chuffed at how my space is turning out but I feel like it needs something else ... any tips? Image: a bed and two tables with yellow and white pillows. User 1: A rug! User 2: Yep! A big floor rug with some texture would be really great. OP: Yes! , I have a tiny little white on in front of the desk but I definitely think something bigger with a pop of colour. ☺️ User 3: Plants!! You have amazing windows for some houseplants if you’re into that kind of thing. I love plants and think they add so much character to a room. OP: Thanks! I'll look into some at my local garden centre !  I need to do my research because I've killed lots in the past 😂✨ User 4: Go with a Pothos! They’re hard to kill and look amazing! Especially in hanging planters. Plus succulents. User 5: Snake plants are pretty much imposible to kill, cactus too (I see you have a lot of sun and you don't have to water them much). Mint is also great but you have to water it regularly. User 6: Plants are like anything, practice makes perfect. You'll learn over time what makes them happy.   You definitely need them as you've got a great base here, but the color palette needs to be livened up a bit. Green will be the most natural color to add to your white/yellow base OP: You can also get fake plants! Nowadays they look pretty realistic, they cost the same as normal plants and they take 0 effort to look nice. Ive had to throw away some big houseplants and I always felt so bad about having to throw away that much money because I'm not able to properly care for them and with fake ones you don't have that problem. Also they easily last a lifetime User 7: Finn? This is my favorite post. The room is truly beautiful though and yellow is my favorite color. OP: Thank you ✨ yes I'm fully obsessed with yellow , it has to be everywhere 😂 User 7: Same 😂 my bedroom is navy and blue right now. Do you have yellow photo frames for the wall of another wall art piece with yellow? That may help spread more yellow around visually. OP: I don't but that's a great idea, thank you , I'll do some shopping! User 7: I wanted to add maybe a gold curtain rods or sheer yellow curtain panels to go with the whites. That would add some color to the desk corner! OP: The curtains absolutely need to be higher. That would solve this issue instantly. You don’t have enough wall space for pictures and you dont have much room for plants. Just hang the curtains higher. OP: I'll get on to that, I was planning on sorting that out but I've got no clue how 😂, time to watch a tutorial 😂 User 8: Honestly you can't go wrong hanging them right up at the ceiling, but ideally they should hang to the floor as well.  I agree, a little subtle color to go with one of your accent colors would be great.  Also hanging plants! :D User 9: Do you have room to pull the furniture away so it’s not squishing the curtains as well? User 10: Two ideas: 1 on your desk add something in a contrasting color and a round or oval shape like a blue lamp or a large purple vase. 2.\tYou could consider getting a bench or ottoman for the foot of the bed.  Looks great so far! OP: Thanks, yeah I like the idea of contrasting colours, I'll shop around! :) User 11: area rug definitely! a floofy yellow one would be so cute OP: Yes! I'll have a shop around, something nice and cosy for sure ✨ User 12: That light and air is something else!! Maybe a comfy bench at the end of the bed, and some plants. Every room needs green. User 13: Does the bed have to be blocking the window? Otherwise nice and add some plants! OP: Yeah unfortunately it's too big to move it around the other way, but the general consensus is more green! User 5: >why don't you move the side table to the other side of the bed and you can have a little more room to move the bed away from the window? OP: My mind is telling me something brass and something green User 14: The blue color of that desk chair goes well with your yellow. You have enough light tones, so I’d note for pillow or throw that pick up those kind of dark denim blues a bit. (not actually denim - just that deep rich blue color). User 15: I’d swap out the white curtains for something with some yellow in them. They don’t have to be a solid color but that’d tie the “theme” color in and brighten up the walls a bit! User 16: Speaking of the curtains, I would hang them up a bit higher. User 17: Color on the walls User 18: Oooh the Hemnes bed frame! How do you find it? Is it well built? I saw some reviews that called it really flimsy... I wanted to buy it, but I don't know anyone who has it to provide feedback. OP: I love it, not flimsy at all and I'm a bigger girl and it holds me fine lol User 19: Love it! Only suggestions I would have are more plants and maybe a rug! But honestly you don’t even need that. It’s so bright and looks so comfy. OP: Definitely a big fluffy rug and some plants! And some Edison bulbs for night time! User 20: lamps would be nice! one for the desk and one for the night stand. User 21: I like the rug idea bring in another color to complement the yellow. User 22: I love this so, so much. Yellow is my favorite color and this would be a dream to come home to! Where are those sheets from? User 23: Another color! A deep purple or dark blue. User 24: An adopted pet.  Edit: also an upholstered bench at the end of the bed could be nice/useful. User 25: Fairy lights ❣️🥰 OP: Yessss I had some but they're currently surfing their purpose on my Christmas tree 😂 User 26: Contrast! Adding something blue or purple (maybe a rug or a pillow or two) will really make the yellow pop. User 27: An accent wall with paint or a large, lovely print would be great User 28: An accent color! Maybe a bold rug or a painted wall. User 29: Flower vase User 30: It's very pretty but is missing water and earth. A mirror or clear glass vases and like another poster said plants. User 31: PLANTS\n",
            "User 94 - eog1zp Original Post: Should I put something on the blank wall above the tv between the windows or leave it empty? If so, any ideas what to put there? Image: a living room with a couch, chair and television above the fireplace. User 1: I had 18 foot ceilings at an apartment once and in no budget. I went to goodwill, got a huge ugly horizontal landscape framed monstrosity from the 1970s that was 6 feet by 3 feet for two dollars (I’ve seen them similarly in other thrift stores for five dollars). I told the picture out and overpainted it a solid blue (almost Rothko-ish), put it back in the frame, and changed the wire direction so it would hang vertical- hung it three feet from the ceiling. It looked expensive, looked modern, linked the living area visually to the height,  thirty minutes total and less than ten dollars for paint, wire, and piece.  You could do any color focus or even a gradient. User 2: I’m not even a fan of Seinfeld, and I think nothing should touch that wall unless it’s the Kramer or George paintings. You know which ones I’m talking about. OP: [yes]([URL] User 2: That will really tie the room together User 3: You have inspired me. I think I just found my new focal point. Lol User 4: He is a loathsome offensive brute. Yet I can’t look away. User 5: I want to see like a super old painting of someone's grandfather or like a Victorian gentleman OP: I like this idea! I never thought of that. Thank you User 6: You should commission a painting of yourself in a smoking jacket with a monocle and a pipe and hang that above the tv User 7: Or in a Napoleonic military outfit User 8: I'd put a larger sized vertical painting. Maybe a portrait that looks old fashioned. OP: I don’t have a pet yet but I do love that idea lol  I agree. I might end up doing that or some kind of funny portrait talking piece User 9: A big clock could go down well User 10: Here is what I would do. 1. That rug is way too small for the space.  2. I would never mount my TV above a fireplace. A fireplace is a focal point, and a TV distracts from it. Now you are talking about somethign above it as well, so you will have a column of items and nothing really anywhere else in the room. It will feel very unbalanced. 3. You lack soft lighting. I see one lamp. Need at least 2 more with soft white bulbs. 4. Art work, good quality stuff from artists, or created by you, something with bold colors to contrast the sterile walls.  I am all for minimalism, but the pieces you use must be large enough for the space. Think scale. User 11: I think you forgot “Yank out the silly columns to nowhere.” They seem like far more of an aesthetic problem than the TV. User 12: Do you have any pets or love animals? [Eh?]([URL] [Ehhh?]([URL]  If you want artwork, that spot is so high up you could make something cheap too. The structure you like from target could be made large-scale with straws or chopsticks. User 13: Family portrait User 14: Adams Family portrait User 15: Ok, I've said this before. But since there are so many angles (the windows, architecture, TV, etc.) I would go for something round in that space. User 16: Mirrors are good for bouncing light around. User 15: Since it's already pretty craftsman you could add some wainscoting on the wall jetting out and go up to the ceiling. Don't have to do any decorating afterward. Could do it yourself or with some buddies if you're handy.  Stuff like this: [URL]   [URL] User 17: The thing that jumps to mind is a round iron-work clock, so it's a piece that isn't solid but still fills the space OP: You need to understand that this is wide angle shot. Almost a fish eye lens shot. So the image is very distorted and makes everything in the foreground look a lot smaller than it actually is. Both the furniture and rug are just fine for scale as you can see [here]([URL] and [here]([URL] As far as the TV I’m not going to comment. It works for me and that’s all I really care about. I was only asking about the top area so I appreciate your comments about that! User 10: What design look are you going for? That might help to better  determine what to put there. You have nothing on the walls anywhere else either, so It will look silly with everything in one column over the fireplace.  One of the biggest probelms is little wall space for decor, as there are so many windows. Perhaps free standing art?   This is not an easy room to work with, but if you are happy with it, that is all that matters.   As I said in a different comment, the rug is a bit too small IMO to really anchor the furniture in the space. When I said scale I meant for your wall art if you are going with wall decor in a minimalist design. The space is cavernous.  As examples, see [Here]([URL] or [here]([URL] for rugs. Is it okay to have a smaller rug, yes, but I would not for such a large room. You are not bound by these rules by any means, but just something to consider. User 18: I’d invest in a few neck massage sessions OP: We usually only use it for no more than 30 minutes at a time. It really isn’t that bad User 19: I'm going to run against the grain of this thread and say no, I don't think you should put anything there, and certainly not a framed piece of art. That wall is already very blocky with the windows/fireplace/tv, and it would just be a bit much to add yet another square to make it even busier. Also, it is just too high. This isn't a salon in Paris.   If you were to put something there, I would go for something that shows the wall color through it and is very simple (like one of those abstract metal wire criss-cross pieces). That spot should not be the focus of the room, so don't put something there that feels distracting or like it *ought* to be at eye level (a portrait or something similar). Also, in response to those suggesting a mirror - just no. You'd get a nice reflection of the ceiling which would be pointless. User 20: How about a look a like window to confuse guests that try to figure out how it doesn’t conflict with the fireplace. User 21: TV is WAY too high, even for this sub OP: Not really what I was asking but thanks for the opinion. We have a dedicated movie room with a 120” projector screen so the most we even use this is probably 30 mins at a time and that’s usually when eating a quick meal or also cooking in the kitchen to have some background noise. It works for me so that’s all I really care about.   Also, since I wanted a TV in the living room what would you propose the alternative would be? Rip out the fireplace and put some drywall up just for the sake of a better viewing angle? Or one of those [really aesthetic mantle mounts]([URL] ? Just trying to determine how to put the TV lower since it’s way too high.\n",

User 1: I could see a colorful Moroccan rug there! Looks great ! User 2: Agreed! Red or orange would be awesome. User 3: On a side note, how do you like the size of your entryway? I found a house plan I really like but am wondering if this type of foyer causes traffic jams. Thanks! OP: Doesnt cause traffic jams. But there are only two of us :) we dont hang out in this area except when doing laundry or leaving for work. User 4: [Pale green wool Bokhara]([URL]  [Red wool Kashkoli]([URL]  [Super Cheap Polypropolene Great Pattern]([URL]  [Muted Blues Geometric]([URL]  [Natural Jute in six colors]([URL]  [Modern indoor/outdoor]([URL]  What fits your style? OP: I love these!!! Thank you SO much. How long should my rug be? From the door to the cutout is 10 feet User 4: Under the door clearance will determine everything. OP: Ok, gotcha. I'm new at this. So when opened my door is 3 feet. So I would place the rug 3 feet from the door? User 4: That is clearance from the opening.  How much space is there between the bottom of the door and the floor.  How much rug can fit under the door? OP: 7/8 of an inch. User 4: Okay, so that's not much space for a rug.  IS the bottom of your door wood or does it have a weather blocking strip? OP: Just wood! User 4: Awesome.  So you could shorten the door and raise the threshold if you wanted to.  The threshold is the floor of the door hole. User 4: Open the door and measure from the bottom of the door to the floor.  Is that what you did to get a gap of 7/8 inches? User 4: Yes, this is also important if the rug won't fit under the door User 4: Measure the floor clearance of your interior closet doors too, if they will be impacted.  If the closet clearance is small, your big rug idea may not work, and you could put a smaller rug at the front door only. User 5: Stay away from earth tones, that is a lot of brown and cream, needs to be broken up. Is there any other color in the adjacent room? User 6: Love that table! Where’d you get it? OP: Amazon! User 1: Link please OP: [URL] User 1: Thanks so much!! User 7: I would put a black and white rug there. It depends on the rest of your color scheme though. Do you have other colors in that area? OP: Right now it's just blacks and whites and brown's. I want a bit of some color. My bathroom next to the front door is a turquoise and peachy thing. Sounds gross but is cute :) User 8: A rug that goes with the vibe of the rest of the house. Take some colors (that stick out through you home) and incorporate them a bit into the pallet of the rug. This way, the house will feel more cohesive User 4: So, the pile height on the pale green rug is .05 inches.  It would work. But it is only 2' x 3' and is a one of a kind, and so it is too small.  The pile on the red rug is also .05.  It is 2'9\" x 5'5\".  You can make a mock rug out of paper or plastic to see the size in situ.  The Muted Blues is also .05, and comes in various sizes.  I think you'll find that the clearance you have on that door will accommodate most rugs.  EDIT:  What about the closet doors though? OP: Hi, thank you so much for all of your help. I really appreciate your guidance. I have been having some trouble with wayfair so I decided to get a runner from amazon. I actually just made a new post about it. But I wanted to express my gratitude and thank you for taking so much time out of your day to help!! User 4: Girl. You do you. That’s the best part of design. Can’t wait to see the photos. User 9: Just make sure you get the under the rug sticky kinda pad so the rug doesn’t move around. It’ll get old reallllllly fast having to fix it all the time.

            "User 96 - c0emk2 Original Post: Will need a lot of ideas with renovations/decorating. But for now, strip and re-stain the floors a lighter color or keep as is? Entire space is same color except kitchen. Image: empty empty room with three windows and hard wood floors. User 1: repaint the walls white color, not the cheap looking paint on there right now, also repaint the ceiling. OP: I was thinking a very very light grey. Close to an off white. Which type of white paint would look good? And what about the ceiling? I’m terrible at this. User 2: A blue grey maybe. Or a blue grey wall and white ceiling. I’m no professional, just suggestions. User 3: Professional checking in and you're on the right track imo. A cool gray wall color and keep the dark floors. Throw in a darker neutral for furniture with splashes of color in art, plants, pillows, rugs and other accessories. Tbh its a damn cozy and interesting space as is. OP: When you say darker neutral for furniture, what color specifically would work best for a couch, coffee table, or tv stand (tv will go on the wall above the stand)? We were thinking of this color couch or similar. Professional suggestions?   [URL] User 4: Either colors of this particular couch would look good here. I really like the blue. User 5: I think the blue is a little dark (I prefer the grey but just get whatever you want) and would recommend either a lighter looking carpet (not recommended if you wear shoes inside) or 2-3 light gray throw pillows that would tie in with the walls or other colors that would be nearby. User 6: I would do a textured gray, similar to [these]([URL] walls. User 7: hah, \"millennial gray\"! Its the modern version of all those old 70's houses that were painted puke green and mustard yellow.  &#x200B;  \\*30 years from now someone looking at an apartment\\* \"Why did everyone want their houses to look like the inside of depressing office spaces?\" User 8: Keep the floor as it is looks amazing. Don’t go crazy with dark furniture as I would be my first instinct. User 9: This. And add a rug in front of the sofa if needed to further break up the flooring color. User 10: I second that-- this floor is dreamy. User 11: If this were your space, what colour would you paint the walls and what colour would you make the furniture? I am curious because the floor is my style but I do not know what would look best with it for walls and furniture. User 12: Keep! User 13: yeah keep, dark floors are awesome and makes it feel more home imo User 14: Floors are BEAUTIFUL. Keep them. User 15: Definitely keep User 16: My ex wife used to have an empty room like this in the house and she would butter the floor and dress me up like a hotdog and roll me around in there for hours User 17: ID on the butter? User 18: Paint the walls maybe if you like but good god keep those beautiful hardwoods User 19: Instead of the floors just repaint all the walls white and paint out the window casings in white. It'll offset the dark floors and make everything pop. User 20: Keep the floor. Add a rug to break up the space User 21: Mate, did you move into the place I was just helping work on? Illinois? OP: NYC here User 21: Damn, two houses over from me looks creepily exactly like that in the front room and I was about to say I'd offer help with any work you'd want, I'd know the wiring enough xD  Looks nice though man, good luck getting it all set up User 22: Keep the dark floors and go for green shade for the walls. Put up some chair railings to class it up. User 23: Keep them, paint the walls a light gray, try gray owl from Benjamin moore User 24: Are you renting? Fuck it, leave it. User 25: The real enemy here is the dark frames on those windows User 26: Keep the floors. Try and get baseboard heaters to replace those big radiators. User 27: Dark floors show EVERY dust bunny. Go lighter. User 28: try smart light strips underneath furniture User 29: I say keep; paint the walls and get curtains and a rug. User 30: Keep the floors. Paint your walls a nice earth tone, a warm grey would look great. Keep the trim white. User 31: Have you considered plastic along all the walls, floor, and ceiling? That hanging light is fantastic. User 10: CFor some reason I’m thinking of Cincinnati when I see this User 32: For the floor stay as is. They're great and easy to clean. Just buy some rugs. Get some long curtains to cover the windows. I think an ash grey would be great. Then you can check out some of wall arts here.   [[URL] User 33: Keep. I would vote for an western motive User 34: As you well know everyone wants you to keep the floors, but knowing that current format apartment myself BUY AN AC UNIT!!! It’s not even July and I’m dying. User 35: I like the dark floors User 10: Where are you? Color is important in you location. User 36: If you want to bring a more dramatic feel into the room when you get to the color/decor part, the dark floors would be great. I've seen pastels look like a million on a floor like that, it really can support any strong design and style.  All the fuss about dust - you swiffer for 2 minutes - done.  The thing to remember is you're going to add rugs, and you can do that in any way you like - you can lay a mosaic of old rugs that leave islands or paths of floor; just laying down a large  jute rug or colorblock rugs will give you a lighter floor.  The windows are a bit tragic. :) If you get to do the windows, maybe look for hopper frames, and consider making a garden window into a feature. They don't have to go into the kitchen, if you have a green thumb you've just given yourself a great display for the hobby, and it increases the amount of light that comes into the room, opens the room to the outdoors - which is healthy.  Whatever is behind that little door either wants a bigger door or one of those click doors that merge into the wall.\n",
            "User 97 - lta2ql Original Post: Suggestions on new rug color? I'm getting rid of this one and not sure blue is the best color. Any other critiques are welcome. Image: a living room with a lot of furniture and windows. User 1: I second the comment about ivory. Ivory, cream or off white would really brighten the space.   My other suggestions would be to mount the tv. I'd replace the blinds with floor length curtains. A bigger coffee table. User 2: Mount the TV, ditch the brown thing it’s sitting on, and slide the white cube shelf under it.  Put some bins in the cube shelf. User 3: Is this a rental?  What color is the sofa?  In a perfect world, one fewer chair, drapes, larger rug, tv console (and wall mount the tv), and the white storage things seem a bit incongruous in here...  At the very least, go for an 8.5 x 11 rug.. User 4: That's the size of a piece of paper User 5: Feet - not inches User 4: Are you sure OP: I got the joke lol. In all seriousness, the rug is basically 6'x9'. User 3: Yes....you need to go up a size or two (preferably 2).  Some should sit under the front legs of the sofa. OP: Yes, it is a rental. The sofa is green and red primarily but there's also a bit of brown and tan in it.   Both the butterfly chair and brown lazy boy will be gone in a month as one roommate is leaving an another is coming. If I were to a eliminate a chair which position is superflous in your opinion? User 3: I think the one next to the white storage unit, but without a floorplan, that's just based on what I see.  So with the lazy boy gone, just put it there to see if it works.  As far as color goes, it's bit dim in here.  Consider changing out the bulbs if you want to brighten things up.  Obviously shades make a difference, but a higher Kelvin should also change the look of things.  The first pic below shows it...[[URL]  ETA If you need the blinds for privacy or light blocking, then they have to stay, but there is a temp fix if not. User 6: I agree with going lighter, ivory/light beige would work well. Also if you can, get a rug that is big enough so at least the front legs of the furniture sit on it. OP: Yeah, the rug is 6'x9', so maybe 7'x10' would be ideal. I've been increasingly considering tan or ivory. My only fear was the color being too close to the chair in the corner. User 6: I think you can go bigger than that- more like 8x10. If you are worried about it matching the chair maybe choose something that has multiple shades of ivory and tan in it? Post updated pics when you make the swap! User 7: your rug needs to be at the end of the couch. User 8: I agree with the cream/ivory rug suggestions (and larger/anchored), mounting the tv and curtains.  One quick thing would switch the position of the brown armchair with the butterfly chair. Currently you have the two visually heavier chairs on one side. OP: The chair thing is a really good point, I didn't think of that but it's quite obvious now you point it out. I'm slowly building my interior design eye.   In a month my roommate is leaving and taking the butterfly chair AND the big brown lazy boy. So I'll have the opportunity to get some different things. At the very least a new butterfly chair for the corner by the couch. User 9: ivory User 10: NGL, I'm digging the plaid couch bigtime!  I agree with the other posters that a larger, lighter rug would be nice.  I would love to see the white storage and TV storage piece replaced with one longer piece - the wood colour is nice. OP: Glad you like the plaid couch, it took some time to grow on me. Got if for free from a friend. It's been a particular challenge to decorate around though because the rug can't have any pattern or it clashes. User 11: You could look into a Sure Fit slipcover for the couch. My husband's grandma gave us a comfy chair that was plaid. Got a cover for it to match our color palette. User 12: How adventurous are you? I love the plaid sofa but would add some color with a large persian rug with burgundy and blues.  Mixing the patterns similar to this   [URL] OP: Huh, I would've thought a patterned rug would clash with the plaid. The pic you shared does look good though, but I'm not sure I could pull it off User 12: What vibe are you going for? Lodge? Rustic? I'm assuming you're trying to work with what you have/keeping within a budget.  So how about this when the butterfly chair and brown recliner are gone:  Slide everything toward the window by about a foot.   Move the white unit to where your shoes are. Cut up & insert a few squares of an old outdoor or rubber doormat and use the bottom cubes to store your shoes.    I agree with the other suggestions of either mounting the TV on the wall or getting a proper stand for it if it's going to stay on that brown cabinet.   Shift the cream chair to the opposite side of the room so it faces the window and can share the side table with the sofa.    If it's in your budget, find a large green plant like a fiddle leaf fig or birds of paradise or even a potted plant on a tall stand and place in the corner (under the animal skull).  Get a few chenille or other soft throw blankets for the sofa& chair and (here's the big one!) if you're feeling bold, maybe try a rug like this (in the dark red) for your room: [URL]  If you need additional seating, you should have enough room to put a small footprint chair of your liking (another butterfly chair, a narrow brown leather clubchair or wing chair) either placed opposite the cream chair or in the corner (where the cream chair is now).  Good luck! User 13: Maybe a lighter coir to brightening up the room User 14: I would go with off white and green. User 15: I would also love to see a rug with tan and/or  cream colors. I think another piece of art to the right of the TV mounted on the wall would be nice. I would also like to see a leafy green plant. If budget allows, perhaps a new coffee table. OP: Where would a good place for a plant be? I have a fake fern on my porch I could bring in. I've been iffy about the coffee table myself. It's a hand-me-down from my great grandparents. But it's kind of weird it being curved like that. User 15: I think putting a plant on top of the white shelf near your window would look nice. Plants filter the air and many are pretty easy to care for. If its a family coffee table you should keep it. :) Just thought it was a little small. User 16: Sandy, fluffy, bigger. It will give coziness User 17: Pull a color from the sofa...do you prefer a lighter look? I’d go with a tan color, it would work with your furniture. A darker vibe, maybe a deep green. That picture above your sofa is awesome, how about a shade out of that? A golden, be bold and go red! Basically, what ever makes you smile, that’s what to go with. Doesn’t matter if no one else likes it, our homes should make US feel good and smile. Have a good time decorating! And let us know what you end up choosing!!!! By the way, what a beautiful space you already have! User 18: Along with the rug suggestions, I would throw in matching throws over the couches. Mainly to soften all the straight lines (the curvy coffee table is a nice contrast)  You could also add in some natural shapes and lines like a basket filled with blankets, or plants...etc User 19: Def a lighter color, creams, maybe a mix that has low pile with some areas of a bit higher pile. Adds interest. User 19: If you got a cream color you could get a couch throw in a cream color to balance out your room. User 20: Take it from someone who bought ivory rugs and then placed them on the floors of her home- they look absolutely lovely when they are ivory, but not so lovely when just a little bit of unexceptional foot traffic turns them gray (we are clean people, we aren’t tracking anything exceptional into the house.). Rugs are much more expensive to have professionally cleaned than floors (why?) and DIY cleaning just doesn’t really get the trick done. If by chance you are on a budget- rethink the ivory suggestion. If budget is not a concern, ivory would look delightful. OP: I'm willing to spend $150 on the rug. There's an ivory shag rug at Wal-mart I could get. My only worry is, I already got a grey/silver shag rug and returned it because it looked weird. Ivory isn't too far different from grey. User 20: I think you’ll find Ivory to make the plaid pop in a way the silver was unable to do. Give it a go! User 21: You could try a rich red to match the couch pillows! OP: Update: So I got a rug, it's smaller than I would've liked but I think the pattern is perfect. It's nothing super impressive but I think the fact that it blends in as opposed to looking out of place means it's a good choice.  I've included close-ups of the rug and couch pattern for comparison.

User 1: A structured slightly oversized black blazer perhaps User 2: A corset top would look cute with it OP: I never thought of this, you're right! Thank you, I'll try it out! But what types of bottoms would I pair with such a top combination? It would feel a bit fancy I imagine, but would matching jeans work or maybe a long skirt of some sort? User 2: np! I would style is with a black corset and black mini skirt, or a more neutral colored corset (brown, olive green) and flare jeans. User 3: OMG CUTE. for a more trendy look I would DEFINITELY wear this with baggy jeans and a chunkier sneaker. For jackets maybe just a shirt jacket OP: That's such a good idea! I should get baggy jeans, shouldn't I? I have all skinny jeans haha!    I've actually been looking into getting white chunky sneakers, but wow, most of them are so expensive. Do you know of any alternatives or brands that aren't as heavy on the wallet? User 3: Definitely check out asos for any shoes. They can be super cheap and they’ve always been great quality for me. My go to baggy jeans are Levi’s dad jeans, but you can also look on asos for those too. They’ll be a lot cheaper for great quality!!! OP: Thank you so much!!! I appreciate you! User 4: I have a similar blouse and I wear this clueless style yellow checkered dress on top of it User 5: This is so lovely! Where did you get that from? OP: Thank you so much! I got it used from an app called Depop. I'm not sure where the original seller got it from and there's no tag anywhere on the blouse. However, after a quick search of 'plain white light academia blouses' I found some similarly styled ones if you're interested. :) User 6: Might be 80s User 7: Light wash baggy jeans or a long black ribbed skirt! A long denim skirt would be so cute too 💕 User 8: Wide leg trousers would be fun OP: Hey there! I'm looking for some advice on how to style or Layer This cute blouse. For reference, I'm a small female and I love simple coquette/hyper feminine attire. I absolutely love this blouse but im really struggling with what to pair it with without it looking out of place. Thank you!! User 9: Tucked into a pair of vintage wide leg flared jeans with a lighter wash, dark brown platform heels or clogs and maybe a vintage suede leather low hanging purse. Maybe some brown tinted silouette sunglasses\n",

            "User 100 - vs1v8o Original Post: Blank Slate- Where do I put my TV and how should I arrange sofas, etc. Image: the interior of an empty room in a house. OP: Room is 15 ft x 19 ft.  I have painted the walls greige since this picture was taken.  No interest in TV above fireplace.  Thanks! User 1: You say you have no interest in TV above fireplace likely because you're wise enough to not want the TV too high to watch comfortably. However, have you considered a TV mount above the fireplace that pulls down to the correct height? Look up \"Mantelmount\" as an example. OP: Yeah I looked into mantelmount, they even have some really cool motorized models.  In this case we will likely be watching a lot of TV in this room, so if the TV is above the fireplace, likely most of the seating will result in having to turn your head 90 degrees one way or the other to watch the screen, which isn't great ergonomically.  Maybe there's a way to do it that avoids that, but that was my first thought. User 1: Maybe I'm missing something, but why not have your seating facing the fireplace+TV? Floating couches have been a thing for a while, you don't need to slap it against a wall. User 2: If you don't want to the put the tv above the fireplace, isn't there only one other wall in this room? User 3: My problem with this room would be having the light shining on the TV screen all the time. I'd watch the light from the windows and see how far it reaches onto the right wall. If the light wouldn't hit the height of the TV screen, I'd put it against that wall, otherwise I'd try diagonally in the corner on the left of the fireplace if you could get it at an angle that the light won't hit the front of it. Particularly look at the time that you would most likely be watching tv if the light is shifting a lot through the day. User 4: Or just get blinds or curtains that can block the light when TV is going User 3: Sure, I’d just rather keep curtains and blinds open during the day if it’s possible. OP: That was my first thought too!  I already ordered motorized blinds so that I can schedule them with the sun to avoid TV glare :) User 5: Since placement above the fireplace is out, I see two options.   First option: place tv in the corner between the fireplace and window and get an L shaped sectional sofa. Arrange with the long side of sectional sofa opposite the windows, the shorter side facing the fireplace. In this scenario I’d put a row of low bookshelves under the full length of the windows. I’d get a vintage Lane Acclaim triangular/corner shaped side table for under the tv (mostly because I am already pricing one online as I have the matching coffee table and the lower shelf is practical for under tv equipment). Really any corner-friendly shaped end table or desk would work but I always lean toward vintage stuff. If more tv equipment space is needed beyond corner table, flank with smaller cube shelves (or something similar in size). Put slim profile a console or sofa table behind the short side of the sofa like another post suggested.   Option 2: Put tv on lower profile media console table opposite fireplace. Put a long sofa on wall side of fireplace, facing 2 comfy armchairs on the window side of fireplace. Place a side table between chairs, get ottomans if space allows, rectangular coffee table in center. You could also do two sofas flanking the fireplace but that might be too formal, less comfortable imo.   I’d put shelves going up both sides of the fireplace, preferably built-in with maybe a cabinet on the bottom, sort of like fireplaces in craftsman homes (I’ll link some photos). You might even consider a beadboard (I think that’s what it’s called) 3/4 height chair rail or wallpaper on the fireplace wall to help ground the space since the ceiling is so high. Wall art will also be key, I’d get a mix of pieces, including something large but not too large for the wall opposite the windows. A couple of floor lamps would a good idea. I love those chrome arc eyeball lamps for a big space. Also some plants!   I’d put a darker colorful area rug under the full the seating area (like a classic Persian style, w warm deep jewel tones, crimson reds, golds etc.) to ground the space so your eye is drawn down as well as up to the high ceilings. Just get one large enough for the space, fitting under all the seating furniture pieces.  With the tv on a lower profile console facing into the seating area and fireplace, if you center it on the stairway wall, you could extend the stairway wall with a higher profile bookshelf or slim profile console directly behind the tv to serve as de facto room divider and to protect it from tipping while concealing wires etc. Or perhaps you could have something custom-built to extend from the stairs for this purpose.  I’d advise bamboo blinds/shades for sun glare on the tv during the day/early evening. Especially important if the windows face due west or due east if there are windows directly across the street that can reflect sun glare directly into your eyeballs (my unfortunate giant fireplace room set up taught me this the hard way). Bamboo would warm up the space and still block light/glare. I like roller shades as you can adjust them. Louvred shutters would also look nice, painted to match the trim.   It’s a great space so whatever you do, enjoy!   Links:  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL] OP: Appreciate the time you put into this, thank you!  I really like the bookcases idea, and I'm sure my wife will like it even more than me haha User 6: PAINT IT WHITE DEAR GOD OP: Literally the first thing I did after buying the house haha.  Well not WHITE white, but a subtle greige. User 6: Thank goodness User 7: This is a dream place for having a video projector. Put your couches on the window side and mount your projector above the couches. You can decorate the area around the screen with plants. It will be a cool place. OP: Interesting!  I was originally thinking maybe a projector screen that came down in front of the middle windows (I already ordered motorized blackout curtains for them).  My only concern is that maybe there's too much ambient light from other windows nearby and the bay window above? User 8: No tv over the fireplace! OP: Agree! User 9: I would do a big L shaped sectional, facing the TV with the other leg of the L on the wall with really high ceilings (facing window). I’d throw a console table behind the back of the couch that you face when you walk in so you can throw keys on as it seems this is directly off the entrance to the house. I’d mount the TV over the fireplace as there’s already hookups, and put a chase or chair in the corner between windows and fireplace facing the couch for a cozy little nook   Edit- just saw your comment about no TV above fireplace. Whoops. - in that case I would just flip the L for the couch to be in the window side. Have TV on big wall, chase pounds in opposite corner. Only problem is TV going to get swallowed up by that wall. TV height is going to be eye level and there will be a lot of dead space above. OP: That was my biggest concern too, that wall is so huge, I don't even know where to start with it haha.  I see so many people getting roasted for putting their TVs above the fireplace, I don't want that to be me! User 9: Don’t let Reddit comments dictate how you design the space you’ll probably spend the most time in!!! Do your thing. I think you should hang some artwork. You can go a little higher than you would with a TV. And you can get some tall indoor trees to add some height to that wall and flank whatever art work you decide to hang up. User 10: Sofas/sectional against windows with Tv on opposite wall User 11: If possible throw out fireplace It's ghastly.use that wall for seating plus wall opposite windows. Tv under staircase wall (perhaps lose portion of banister to accommodate tv hight.)small bookcase under windows (that light begs to have a good book read in it) with a few plants on top. Nice piece of art above where the fireplace was (full color as it'll be providing the warmth in the room)and if you can stand it (I cant) a large low coffee table, in that space with your light requirements I'd opt for glass, tho personally I'm all for extra storage which depending on your taste would either be bleached pine or super dark like a Japanese lacquer. Whatever you decide to do I'd love to see your finished result. User 12: What color sofa do you want to buy\n",

User 1: I have 2, pricey but worth it! maybe for a laundry room you don’t want to spend that much especially if you plan to change the rug often OP: I honestly probably wouldn't change it often. I will definitely check them out! User 2: I love my ruggable rug. They have cute patterns and it is really nice to be able to wash it. OP: Thanks! I definitely think I'm going with ruggable User 3: another vote for ruggable! the standard mat the rugs come with takes some getting used to if you’re expecting typical rug cushioning, but it’s great imo. User 4: Can you expand on how the mat is different from typical rug cushioning. User 1: It’s like a thin velcro layer, you peel the rug off to wash it and replace it OP: Thank you!!!  I've been thinking of trying them out for sure! OP: I just redid this room. My home is 130 years old, so there is no closet in the master bedroom. I think it used to be a parlor honestly. Anyway, I absolutely love how my laundry room came out, especially my closet solution. However, I think it needs a rug to feel cozier. Because of the wallpaper, I'm unsure what kind of rug would look nice there. User 5: Your laundry room/closet idea is genius OP: Thank you so much! I love it now! It used to be so ugly lol. User 6: Your clothes probably always smell like detergent!! I wish I had the space for this User 7: I saw this as I was dragging my laundry downstairs to the communal machines, jealous doesn’t begin to cover it lol   What about a shaggy green rug, the same shade as the green on your gorgeous wallpaper?? OP: Oh no!! Communal machines are the worst. I'm sorry!   Oh I love that! Shaggy would be nice and cozy for sure. I hadn't thought of matching greens. That's definitely a great idea. Also thank you! I stumbled upon that wallpaper on etsy, and designed the room around it. I love it so much! User 7: I think that would be super cute and cozy and warm! You could even do a large circle rug in the middle of the room.   Plus if a spill happens it probably wouldn’t be too obvious on the green OP: Thank you so much! Totally different direction than I was thinking, but I love it. It's a pretty big room, so I think that could be great User 8: I would do an indoor/outdoor area rug. That way, if detergent spills on it or something, you can just take it outside and hose it off. That what I do in my basement laundry room. OP: Spills are definitely something to think about! Thank you! User 9: Any color close to one in the beautiful wallpaper would go nicely. Even a blue like your hangers would compliment the room. OP: Thank you!!! That blue is definitely my favorite color! It pops up in other places throughout the house, so maybe that's a good direction to go. User 10: Maybe a couple of runners in front of the machines and in of clothes racks. OP: That would definitely help define the spaces. Thank you! User 11: Omg, laundry IN your closet?! That’s the best idea I’ve ever heard User 12: This is so cute!!!! My house is 80 years old and I don't have a closet in my bedroom either. I might steal this idea!! OP: Thank you so much!! This used to be my least favorite room in the house. When we moved in it was green with splotches of green on the ceiling. One wall was mysteriously left beige, and we quickly installed one of those home depot closet world set ups. It was cluttered and ugly. The closet change was kind of last minute, because I didn't want to hide the wall paper. It was SO easy, and I love it! I think Alexandra Gater did something similar in a video. User 13: Grey so every piece of dryer lint on it doesn't mock you OP: Lol!! I have dogs and cats, so I've learned to turn a blind eye to fuzzies. User 13: Lol good point User 14: Lol, why do you need the laundry room to be cozy?

            "User 103 - n32z06 Original Post: Any help thinking out what colour my closet should be? Image: a room with hard wood floors and walls and a white door. User 1: I think you should paint it the same color as the walls. It will blend in and not stand out as a big piece of furniture. OP: It doesn't really stand out as such a big piece of furniture actually User 1: It would if you painted it white. User 2: My rule for painting is if I want to draw attention to something I paint it a different color than the background color. (Like attractive woodwork, for example, or an accent wall). If it’s a distraction or unattractive or simply shouldn’t be a focal point, it gets the same color as its surroundings. (So conduit mounted on the wall, or trim that there’s solely to cover a seam between panels or a ventilation drill, or a closet that doesn’t have lovely decorative lines).   If you’re closet had pretty doors and woodwork, I’d do the wall parts of it to match the walls in the room and the doors to match the woodwork. Yours as it is? Add as many  coats of the current color as needed to get a good finish and no show through User 3: The same color as the walls! Just add another coat (or two?) and it would be lovely and create a better blank backdrop for your more aesthetic furnishings/art. OP: Please note, the room is really dark because there a coating on the window. I've opened the window to take the picture so the picture is actually much more ligther than it would be (tho I took the picture in the evening so there wasn't much light).           When I painted the walls I spilt some paint on the closet door and went \"whatever\" and painted one layer quickly over the entire thing, but I'm not sure I do want keep it that colour (with a new coat of  paint ofc). My mom who's helping me is very set on that I should paint it white but I'm also not so sure on that. User 4: Aesthetically, I agree with your mom, but I think painting it white, now that it is dark green, is going to be very difficult to achieve..Whichever color you choose, you’re probably going to have to prime it to keep that dark color from showing through. User 5: Black or a dark gray would cover the blue more easily than white. White would look fine but stand out a lot. Or you could add more color by painting it a dark mossy green or plum. User 6: GOLDEN OP: If I keep it green I'm definitely getting golden handles,   or I wonder if I should paint it ocher yellow, but I think the whole thing as 'actual' golden is a little too much for my taste.        (But gold and dark green DO look nice together :D) User 7: Coral or kind of mustardy gold User 8: Brilliant Cobalt Blue with gold trim and hardware User 9: If you wanted to make the closet stand out you could look into some fun temporary wallpapers that are made for apartments with some patterns to make a statement. Maybe add some trim if you did that. User 10: maybe something more creative than painting just a color... perhaps use a chalkboard paint or cover it with a collage of personal photos. The closet itself isn’t necessarily a display piece, but you could decorate it in a personal way with photos that make you feel nice :) perhaps using command strips to attach a lightweight full length mirror would be nice? User 11: golden or pink ;)\n",

Image: a bed room with two pairs of shoes on top of it. User 1: Anything black here is some inspo.   [[URL] OP: Thanks User 2: These go with so much, black trousers/jeans obviously, then tops in red or blue, with some white thrown in. Dark jeans with a white top, even better if the top has some of the same colours as the Jordans on. Or the same jeans, white top & hoody/jacket in black & navy/ black & red, although the black & navy will probs be more versatile.  Idk your style but you are bound to find a sweatshirt/hoody/tshirt with the same colours on. A black t-shirt with red detail obvs would look good. Loads of sports & Street West has big colourful designs on atm, so it's a good time to buy co-ordinating pieces.  Or you can go all black with just a bit if colour to match, so like black trousers, black shirt worn open with a black & red top worn under the shirt. Flannel shirts of a similar colours look good too,be specially in the colder months. Also a matching hat if that's your style.  Finally I recommend looking up both current streetwear styles & retro styles to get some inspiration. Obvs oversized is in but personally I think with hi tops you should go for a slimmer leg bottom with a baggier top. User 3: Black jeans, black tee and a red and black check shirt for the red AJ1s is a solid fit. User 4: You could go in a retro direction with skinny/straight white jeans\n",
            "User 105 - k22wpx Original Post: How to decorate this toilet wall space? Image: a wall with bees on it, in a small bathroom. User 1: A number of years ago I got like a ~10pc hexagon-shaped mirror set from IKEA that you could arrange however you wanted. It was copper tinted and would look so good here. I doubt they’re still there but I think the honeycomb look with mirrors or little shelves could work if you want to lean into the theme  Edit: just googled “hexagon mirror kit” they have them at Walmart etc! OP: That's a great idea! Maybe on the white section to tie that with the bees? User 1: Yes on the white section! Also where did this bee wallpaper come from? It’s incredible OP: Homebase, if you're in the UK! User 2: How much a roll? Neeeeeed this OP: £22 :) User 3: I remember this hexagon set! I owned it. User 4: I'm useless here but came to say I love the wallpaper! User 5: Came here to say the same thing User 6: Same! 🤩 User 7: Agree that adding shelves would be great. How about painting the white part black to contrast the wallpaper?  *ETA- some dark wood rustic shelves, then some copper storage accents - oh that would look good!! User 8: Add pictures of an exasperated Nicolas Cage between the bees User 9: this wallpaper is screaming for a honeycomb shaped shelf above the toilet User 10: Add some plants and wax candles! Floral scents :). Yellow hand towels. Maybe a bold yellow black scheme. Love the wallpaper. User 11: I'm curious, is this a house built before plumbing and that white section hides all the plumbing? I know my friends had an old Victorian house and their bathroom floors were 6 in higher than the rest of the house to hide on the plumbing...  Anyway, I like the idea of the shelf a lot! OP: The house is only 40 years old but the previous owners did some interesting things with the plumbing - there is a lot of white boxes around it! User 11: Interesting! I wonder if that was meant to make it more accessible...   Oh well, it gives a character! User 12: The shape of that bulkhead/pipe covering thing bothers me so much, I’d be tempted to paint it. Maybe make it look like a honeycomb, with the side cut out of it or something.  That, or paint it black and then paint a few yellow bees on it.  I have no idea if these are good ideas, lol, just spitballing. User 13: I have a suggestion for the white bulkhead area. Floating shelves of some beautiful kinds thick wood. Then put some plants on the shelves. For the recessed area I’d hang a mobile maybe off a piece of driftwood with some sea glass, or something You could do a black molding too at ceiling & baseboards.   Edit: I thought the recessed area was white. User 14: Something a bit left of field, a hanging plant over the top, then plants and candles and maybe little oddities on the shelf over the toilet, then on the white beam that goes all the way up, lots of weird little pictures in frames User 15: I would take quite a few ideas here and paint the white a creamy honey color, perhaps rag roll it tongive it some depth. Add dark wood shelves flush with the (current) white part, and find those hexagon mirror doo dad's and group them randomly on the face of the (current) white part. Put some plants on the shelves, add a couple of sunflower stems in an interesting container. User 16: If you choose to, then once the sunflower has bloomed and before it begins to shed it's seeds, the head can be cut and used as a natural bird feeder, or other wildlife visitors to sunflowers to feed on. User 17: Giraffe User 18: White shelves for decorations and storage. It's already a busy background so I'd stick with solid coloured bins and canisters. Tp, cleaning supplies, etc. would store well there. User 19: beehive vase User 20: Designing this space is beeyond my skill set. User 21: Sunflowers!!! User 22: Disclaimer: not a professional.   Add a hive for all your bees. That’s it, just a hive.  Edit: this comment is for comedic purposes only. Please do not take this seriously. User 23: A stuffed animal of Pooh Bear standing with his red balloon, trying to get to a bees nest up above.  With Pennywise in the corner behind the toilet emerging from a drain. User 24: I would paint it dark green, and do raw wood shelves in the gap above the toilet. User 25: I'd put in some shelves for storage and decor. User 26: Paint the wood part an accent color. User 27: I think painting where it’s white a hunter green (or any other accent color you like) and copper accents added would look so good!! User 28: Pain the white section beige, the closest colour to match the background colour of the wallpaper, then your eye won't be drawn to it.  Anything bee themed, hexagons will go well as they are more irregular shaped. Stay away adding squares or rectangles as it will just highlight the uneavenness. Ovals could also work as they are the shape of the bees & none angular.   I think gold decorations would go great. Bee decorations are pretty popular atm, so I'm sure you will find things you like. User 29: I second the idea of adding some shelving with plants! Fake plants if you don’t want to worry about them. User 30: Paint wide black and yellow stripes add black floating shelves (in the black stripes) and place a picture of Jerry Seinfeld’s character Barry B. Benson on one of them. User 31: Small Wall Art User 32: Just bee creative User 33: Missing a beehive in the upper corner. User 34: Maybe a shelf in the height of that weird corner and then another one half way? Sadly, your room doesn't seem to have natural light, does it? Otherwise I would put lots of hanging plants on the top shelf. OP: Yes, I think something at that height to kind of hide that corner is a good idea. I took the photo at night, there is a large window, so hanging plants could work! User 35: Removing that wallpaper should be the first step User 36: It’s gotta go.\n",

Give it some thought. 👍🏻 OP: Its a rental so no dice on the spray. Sounds really interesting though! User 8: You could ask the landlord for permission! User 9: Why would you use your own money to inprove someone elses property? User 10: Because you're the person that has to live in it, and you may as well enjoy where you live? User 11: Why would the property owner spend money to paint the ceiling a different color just because the tenant thinks it’ll look nicer with their layout?  If you lease a car do you expect the dealership to upgrade your rims because it’ll look cooler? User 9: Nobody ever mentioned that. And I don't understand why you're responding to me with that. User 11: Ah sorry I thought you were implying the landlord should pay it. It’s too early. My bad. User 12: Because the tenant pays monthly to live in the space, and if the LL wanted to long term happy tenant then the LL would try to accommodate. If the tenant is unhappy with something, LL should listen. Losing rent costs for a month or two is more expensive than getting some painters to paint a ceiling in a few hours.   Please don't buy real estate. User 13: This is an amazing space and def really fun to work with. Is this in NYC? If so - you did well, man! Dream apt.   I'd get another stool so you have 3 and a bigger rug - you'll see a pretty dramatic difference from that alone. For the rug, think of warm and lush. Google \"warm colors\" and choose whichever one you are drawn to -- and get in a texture that feels very luxe... the exposed ceiling (which I love), white walls, and light wooden floor make the room a bit cold so you just need to balance that out with warmth to cozy it up.  From there, get a side table next to the couch. Find somewhere to put all of your bottles - maybe a bar cart on that wall between the kitchen island and the window/patio. Def more plants - you have a lot of windows in the room so they'll probably live just fine. You need big, warm, lush plants also. On that note, you have a large windowsill in your kitchen - if you cook a lot, might be worthwhile to grow some herbs there. Functional, fun, and pretty to look at.  Get new light bulbs that are yellow-y to warm up the space.  Clean up the clutter on all your surfaces and find a method for organizing them so your surfaces are a mix of functional and decorative. Think of where you tend to gather clutter so you can strategize how to outsmart future you. User 14: Great space!!!  What couch is that??? Looks very nice. OP: Thanks! The sofa is Room and Board Andre 101\". It looks great I agree, but honestly, not the most comfortable. User 14: Awesome thanks! User 14: If you're looking to waste a bunch of time during quarantine try shining those copper pipes. User 14: Looks good... get speakers off the floor though ;) User 15: Fantastic, love it!  The *only* thing I can think of to improve is to switch out the yellow rug to a patterned black and white to get that coffee table and couch to really pop User 16: I think I would go slightly larger in the rug too if possible. Check out recommendations for rug sizes in different furniture layouts OP: I've been thinking the same thing... It looked fine until I moved back the sofa and put the rug under it. In my defense, the rug came with me from my last place. OP: Thanks! I'll check out some rugs! I thought the contrast with the sofa was good but you're right, the coffee table kinda disappears. User 3: Or you could move the rug, couch, and coffee table closer to the TV but I’d get a bigger rug instead. It’s the only pop of color you have in the apt so go big and bold (think of it as art on the floor). User 17: Awesome bachelor pad! Where did you get the speakers from? User 18: Needs a rug, eames chair, plants User 19: Paint the walls, shimmering anthracite for example. User 20: Lots a concrete (or looks like). Contrast it with more natural features! A tall standing plant would go great in that corner near that white lamp. Alternatively, maybe a ladder bookshelf to put knick-knacks and plants on. User 14: I think you need artwork and some more personal items displayed so it looks like a home rather than a prop User 21: Man I need to move out of NYC. What city is this? Love the space. User 22: Ya nailed it!! Just add some more wall art above the tele. User 23: Maps and plants.  They work for any decor. User 14: With your color scheme, a nice light green (chair, painting, plants) would compliment the yellow rug and contrast the grey and brown. User 24: Spend whatever you feel appropriate to fill out that wine rack. Also get some plants, hanging if you don't have floor space for regular, look up their care, it's not that hard, pretty much just need 1 pints of water a week for most medium-large plants in summer and 0.5 in winter. If leaves are yellowing, stop watering, if they're yellow with brown tips, more water, less sun. Some will prefer to be by that window, others away from the window, research accordingly. And if you want them to look really healthy, mist their leaves with water a few times a week User 25: Paint and clean up those pipes. User 26: Honestly just clear nearly everything off the sink counter and organize/get rid of clutter. User 27: Get a more powerful and bigger rag. Additional to this, get some nice curtains. The rag just don't match with the wooden furniture and the floor. Get yourself a blanket in black&white to slap over the sofa. Get rid of the little foot bench infront of the couch and put it somewhere else. Make some more warm light by putting nice lamps in the corners. Get some plants that have big foliage. Just some. Like a nice bananaplant or a fiddle leaf fig but make sure they are standing near the window. User 28: get those speakers off the floor for starters. User 29: Mount that TV and hide the cables User 30: This looks amazing! I'm imagining the clear bottle being whiskey that you used in the Instant Pot for a delicious beef recipe. The one thing you could improve is to give me that recipe! Take care and be well! OP: Thanks! That bottle is actually a wine growler of all things. While I do have a whiskey collection (you can kinda see it in front of the fridge), I don't have a good beef recipe that isnt \"throw on a hot cast iron\". What I do have is an Asian pork instapot recipe that's bomb.\n",

            "User 108 - lsslls Original Post: Ugly kitchen in new rental, need advice on how to make it not suck. Image: a room with a chair, a sink, refrigerator and microwave. User 1: I would def do a peel-and-stick backsplash, it'll make a big difference. Instead of covering the cabinets in vinyl like someone suggested, I'd cover the countertops in vinyl/contact paper of some sort. You could do a dark grey concrete vinyl for example, but there's tons of options out there. It'll take some finessing to make it look right but it'll definitely easier than covering all the cabinets which sounds like a nightmare lol. Depending how much you wanna do you could also replace the cabinet hardware, with black or brass knobs for example. User 2: This is the one. The peel and stick backsplash and vinyl stick-ons for the countertops with some new hardware if you plan on staying for a while. OP: Thanks for the advice. I'm here for at least a year now. I do think fresh hardware and a change to the counter top color would be a big improvement. User 3: Since it’s a rental you’re kind of stuck with the suck. You can add some art to the area above the cabinets, some colorful magnets on the fridge and stove, or maybe paint if you’re allowed. User 4: Make your kitchen items -bowls, utensil holders, appliances - your decorations. magnets onf the fridge, and certain plants/small prints.  I wouldnt call it an ugly kitchen, I would say its plain. User 5: It's not ugly, it's just plain basic one.   I would not spend money on sticker tiles. You can't re-use them somewhere else, because dimensions would probably be different, and they may damage the backsplash.   Hang curtains, get nice placemats, chair pads. Get colorful appliances, ceramics, etc, - there are tons of nice kettles, toasters, soap containers, jars for pasta etc.   Add peel and stick LED lights under cabinets. OP: Thanks for the input; I agree once I get my countertop appliances unpacked and some decorating done, it will look much better. I considered the peel and stick backsplash, as others had mentioned, but you raise a good point. User 6: I actually really like it! Be deliberate about where you place your countertop appliances to avoid a cluttered feel, light up all the under-cabinet areas, and hang colorful stuff on the sides of the cupboards by the sink. User 7: Paint the walls and see if you can get new appliances...other then that, I wouldn't mess with the cabinets or light fixture...you can add like a fake backsplash... OP: Unfortunately, I can not paint or change the appliances. I think with some color added with utensil holders and countertop appliances, it will really change the feel of things. User 7: Dang. Painting it would have been your best bet 🥺😫 User 8: Contrasting paint colour on the cupboards. User 9: Use vinyl to cover the cabinets or even just the fridge, easy to stick and also to remove later. Would recommend Jess Rose vinyl!\n",

User 1: If you wear this as a top on its own, I can totally imagine pairing this with a pair of wide legged palazzo pants or any pairs of white pants if you have any - I feel like that’s an easy and effortless way to style it, or a pair of blue light washed jeans that have a regular or looser fit to balance out with how fitted the bralette is.

I already have so many gallery walls in my house, but wanting something different here. Open to paint suggestions too! Image: a room with white walls and a large table and chairs. User 1: Sideboard, mirror and either sconces or a pendant light/chandelier. OP: Would you paint that wall or leave as-is? User 2: What if you went for a bold, mural wallpaper? As an accent wall? User 1: I think that would depend on the rest of the room. Do you want that whole wall to be an accent wall?  It might look odd with the door. User 3: If you go the sideboard route, please make sure you have enough space to open the cabinet doors and for people to walk behind the bench if someone is sitting at the table.   The space looks pretty tight, but it may just be the angle of the photo. User 4: This is the perfect wall for a wall paper accent wall. Peel & stick is the way to go! OP: I thought about that. It’s a bit intimidating. Also what you’re not seeing is the other side of that door is a 2 inch gap to the other wall. Wasn’t sure how hard it would be to wallpaper that little piece User 4: It’s totally manageable! The two inch gap will be annoying but not that bad. Just make sure you use one of those $2 plastic wall paper scraper tool things. I’ve wall papered  much more complicated areas and they always turn out awesome! User 5: That blue orchid is sooooooooo beautiful 😍 I have one myself haha 😄 Are you looking for art or just color ideas for the wall? I have some paintings that may go well with that wall.... I'd be happy to share a rendering of them on the wall if you were looking for that kind of option. No worries if not! OP: Open to art, but no need to spend time on a rendering!  Thanks!! User 6: If you have room, I second the vote for a sideboard with a mirror over top. If there isn't enough depth for the side board, you might also consider doing a very shallow console table to achieve a similar look. OP: Thoughts on color of the sideboard? User 7: Wallpaper accent wall: [URL]  Or a big framed vintage map, vintage travel posters. [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  Maybe add a shelf or shelves.

Just something big and that you love to look at!

Thank you! User 10: Nice taste. User 9: Thanks! User 11: plenty of plants can survive there. A Peace Lily on a low stand would do well, as would some types of palms.  Just do some research on shade-living plants.  Also, add indirect lighting to that wall, a small lamp in the corner shelf would be good, the top square shelf is ideal for it. User 12: With the cat tower in the foreground, I would recommend against a peace lily. While they're not as toxic to cats as true lilies, they're still mildly toxic and can make your cat sick. User 13: My favorite cat-safe low-light low-maintenance plant is a snake plant.  Lived in my bathroom (with almost 0 light) with once per month waterings (if that).  Even I could keep it alive!! User 12: Yes I have a few snake plants that I forget to water much too often and they thrive in my north facing office. My kitten has also occasionally gnawed on them and had no side effects (though I try really hard to keep him from chewing on plants in general) User 11: I recommend sowing a handful of oats or barley for that.   I bought some overpriced \"cat-grass\" for my wannabe-lion and turns out that it's just barley. User 14: A basket with some blankets would look cute and be functional! :) User 15: An identical bookcase to the one on the other side. Or move your cat tree near the window and put a wall shelf above it for your plant.    Or place an upright storage cabinet or spare chair under the circle User 16: A floor lamp that doesn’t go up high enough to interfere with the art. User 17: Rotan basket User 18: I’d move the art over the tv and put a similar bookcase there User 19: Definitely snake plant. It doesn’t need lot of light User 20: Turntable? User 21: Christmas tree for now? User 22: Honestly, i don't think you need anything there. It's okay to have negative space. User 23: floating shelves with books & fake plants? or small plants on shelves that don't need much light User 24: What if you put the cat tower there and an end table buy the couch and chair User 25: I would love to see the cognac colored chair over there angled toward the couch.

User 42: How about a bunch of candles in different sizes or a bunch of candles in glass vases? :) User 43: I agree, three big vases of various sizes. Or two musical instruments to make the detail from the shelf on the other side. User 44: Move the couch out from the wall, move the coffee table further from the couch, move the chair to a space further from both so that it could feasibly look outside, at the couch, or at the TV and now you have a room not necessarily built around watching TV.   Now put whatever you want to the left of your TV and it won't feel like an accessory to your television. A book shelf, shelving of some other sort, an art wall, a floor lamp, a desk, a big plant.  You have a lot of options but damn this room needs to breath a little my dude. Looks like you crammed everything against the wall opposite the tv  Edit: get a bigger carpet in that room and mount your TV either on the wall above the console or on a floor mount above the console and your room will look drastically better User 45: There are lots of plants that can survive with very little light.  Check with your local nursery. User 46: Hang it outside\n",
            "User 115 - amf3rx Original Post: Moved in Yesterday - what are your suggestions? (more pics/Floor plan in comments) Image: a long, well - lit apartment hallway features a wood table, a couch, and a black leather chair. User 1: A gigantic piece of art on the couch wall OP: good point. unfortunately we can't hang any nails or paint over the white wall. decals maybe? User 2: You can buy hooks that stick onto walls so you don't have to nail into them. Also, spackle exists. Wall art is what this place needs most imho, so that's a big one.   User 3: If the walls are white you can make nail holes in them and use $5 Spackle and your finger to fill them in when you're done.  Only a trained eye could tell you did anything.   Could also get a wall hanging system [like this]([URL] so the holes would be in the ceiling corners.  If you're worried about holes could always get a [sofa table behind the couch]([URL] and rest artwork on that.  User 4: Is there enough space to switch the living room with the dining area? Pros to switching layout: Gorgeous window view while eating, lots of natural light there, and it will feel more open while you're sitting at the table since you won't be bumping elbows with a big wall; TV wouldn't be against the bedroom wall anymore (better for if you're trying to sleep while someone is using it), reduced TV glare from window. Cons to switching: Couch would be next to entryway, and there would be a walkway right between the TV and seating. User 4: Actually, damn, is that TV unit built in to the wall? OP: unfortunately yes, the TV unit is attached to the wall and can't be moved. Maybe putting the table on the other side of the room (where the plug is)? User 4: I think it depends on what you want to be the first thing you see when you first enter, what you want the overall vibe to be for the whole room, and what kinds of other things you plan on adding. The architectural design in the living room and bedroom is already very sleek and geometric with those sweet windows, rectangular built-ins, and circular columns, but it's not in a way that's overbearing so you can choose to go in a different direction with the styling or to really work with it and play it up.  &#x200B;  Defined, cozy space:  The table on that other wall could definitely work, and putting it there would help to break the room into chunks so that not everything is on the same line of sight. It could help zone the space. If you can't paint the table a lighter color, you'd need to jazz it up in some way to make it more interesting to the eye. With the dark color it is now, it contrasts enough with the wall that it's going to draw attention. You can work with that to make it a good focal point of your entry way by adding something to bring the area more vertical, if that makes sense. Art/decals, tall plant, good lighting... or something. I saw in another comment that you can't put holes in the wall, so you might have to get creative.  &#x200B;  You can polish off that cozy, zoned scheme by adding rugs like u/minimotres suggested, and art above the couch like u/TalkingFromTheToilet said. Think about the colors you might want to incorporate. The couch is going to compete for attention since it's so dark compared to the walls and floor, but if you add more dark things in the area it can balance it out, as well as if you add lighter-colored throws and cushions to break up the block of black.  &#x200B;  Sleek, unified space:  On the flip-side, you can also work with the narrowness of the room and make a space that feels really sleek and modern since you have that huge window, white floors/walls, high ceilings, and a clean-cut monochromatic sofa/TV unit. If you can use that table somewhere else and get a small glass table (or a white glossy one, or a dark one with, again, something above to bring it more vertical), it could bring the whole room up a notch and unify the theme, and *that* type of table could  possibly work on either wall. You'd need different chairs to match.  &#x200B;  Then you could have some sort of long simple-patterned rug tying the dining area to the sofa area, which would guide the eye between the two areas and bring everything together despite how elongated the room is. So you'd have less visual separation between the spaces, but it might work because with a fitting table, you've got a unified theme.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Unrelated edit: That bedspread's gotta go. It doesn't work with the ottoman you have in there, because the ottoman is dark, leathery, and has that classy mature tufting (?), and the pattern and colors on the bedspread kind of clash with that vibe. Try a solid-colored bedspread in a nice material. Experiment with folding your bed-throw in different ways too; you'd be surprised how different that can make a room look. I'd recommend different cushions on the bed too, unless you want to play up the red-pink-white scheme. OP: Awesome, thank you for the comments! Very good points. one of the difficulties I see most is the strong black/white that the place has. The light cushions are definitely something I was looking at, as well as  - a plant (obviously) maybe between TV and window - maybe a floor lamp between couch and window - a rug between tv and couch - not sure about a coffee table. the room feels wider than it looks in the picture (about 3m wide) - having a glass one could still make it feel spacious  And yes, the bed spread and all the tissues etc will go. It was literally the only linen I had, but was thinking to go with neutral slightly patterned sheets ([something like these maybe]([URL] User 4: Yes! Great ideas. Neutral patterned sheets would look excellent here. The ones you linked, or ones like that, would be perfect. They're just interesting enough to be a focal point for the room without being overbearing.  User 5: No it's a tv unit  OP: Additional pictures and floor plan here: [URL] User 6: That looks so SG.

You can put it against the wall and use it as a storage surface but if you have company you can pull it out and sit 6 people around it for a full dinner or a game night.  Hang some nice art above it to help fill the space. User 5: Bar cart! User 6: 2nd bar cart it’s the perfect space for it OP: We use the bar on the left for eating, so we don’t need a dining table. I was originally thinking a chair and bookshelf, but not sure.   Would love some ideas! User 7: A dog User 8: Obvious suggestion would be get a dining table, however I would use that space for a nice chair to read the books I'd put on the bookshelf by the wall. User 9: We just bought [this drop leaf table]([URL] from Wayfair because we didn’t have much space for a dining area, and we love it. Much heavier and sturdier than expected, and the brown we got ended up matching out floors perfectly. Pretty easy for one person to put together too. User 10: Get a bigger sofa. User 11: Air hockey User 12: Spread out your current stuff a little more. You can't enjoy your space if everything is packed as tight as can be. User 13: Bookshelf or a fish tank would look good there! User 14: Unrelated to the question, but what's the ID on those counter stools OP? OP: Got 'em at Target: [URL] User 15: If you dont need a dining table/chair how about a large floor mirror like this one i got from Ikea ([[URL] recently.... add a big plant(s) and maybe a bar cart?? User 16: Stripper pole User 17: Another couch or a couple of accent chairs? User 18: Paint the wall red or dark grey User 19: PROJECTOR WALL\n",
            "User 117 - dmlaj1 Original Post: (23) First time living on my own, I'm also a student. I know it's pretty basic, suggestions? Image: a living room with purple lights and a couch. User 1: Id ditch the douchebag lights from a girl perspective it doesnt look very mature User 2: We need more of these types of comments User 3: From any perspective, really. User 2: youre feelings cant be this hurt by purple leds User 4: I'd suggest removing those lights.  Those are only appropriate in the bedrooms of adolescents, night clubs, and Halloween parties.  A couple of stand lamps with a yellow or white light will make the room more inviting. If you love/need the blue, paint the walls or get a picture to hang. User 5: Great space with a ton of potential.   First off, I wouldn’t cover up that fireplace if I were you. I think it adds a lot of character.   One way I’ve found to add interest to a plain space is to angle the furniture such that it isn’t lined up along the walls like a galley. Here’s an article that discusses how this is used by home stagers: [staging link]([URL]   It’s hard to do in a room like this and still have a walkway to the door, but I think you could angle your tv  (allowing you to show off the fireplace) and match the angle with the couch. If that would put the back of your couch toward the kitchen, you could place a narrow console table behind it.   Then you could have foot traffic to the sliding glass doors on either side. Just an idea. I like moving my furniture around every few months to try different things and get different perspectives on my space.   Also, I would get some more art up on the walls (framed... even plastic frames). I don’t want to pile on too much, but I’m not a fan of either the rope lights or the victory flag. I think you can still showcase what you like, but do so in a mature, elevated way.   Last piece of advice, take all the hand-me-downs you can get. I still have some great stuff I got second-hand when I moved into my first apartment. You could use a few extra pieces like an accent chair, side table and lamps. User 6: This is really good advice. User 7: Get rid of the lights. Looks real tacky, unless you are going for a teenager vibe. User 2: Are you a cannabis plant? Ditch the lights, as others have said. User 8: Tuck in your slipcover so it fits tighter. The looseness looks schlubby. Get a floor lamp with warmer lighting. Honestly I don't mind the blue rope lights because they're hung neatly, but warm light is better for working and reading. Put the W flag in a frame or hang it tighter so you don't see the looseness of the fabric. A snake plant would be a good way to bring some life into the space and they're hardy plants if you don't have a green thumb. An area rug would also look nice but they're expensive so I understand if you want to hold off on that one. Maybe get an arm chair for the left side of the couch too? The POANG from IKEA would be a good option and is cheap, comfortable, and stylish. I'm assuming you're near one because that looks like the LACK coffee table lol. OP: Appreciate the feedback! The couch itself is over 15 years old and this is it's last year of use. The cover honestly doesn't really fit it due to the couch not having the back cushions. Honestly thinking about it, all of my furniture is hand me down, so I have no clue where any of it is from. I do know that the closest IKEA is around 4 hours away, so it's possible! Everything else is very doable, thanks again! User 8: If it has seat cushions, you can still tuck in some of the extra fabric at the back.   No shame in hand me downs! It's a good way to save money for furniture you really like down the road. If you're looking to replace the couch keep an eye on Craigslist. You'd be surprised what people list. You can always rent a uhaul to pick it up. Also, if you're a student and live near campus, people often give away big furniture like that as they're leaving town so see if there are any Facebook groups for that. I got a really nice couch for free when one girl was graduating and couldn't take it cross country with her. User 9: Get a ping pong table and some red solo cups, and you'll be all set! OP: Haha ill start my own frat! User 10: Student? Is the W for the study of wumbology? OP: That's actually my major, so I thought the flag was fitting. User 11: Remove those lights and get a nice standing lamp! Maybe a chair or something else to sit on. User 12: Have an L flag ready. OP: Oh trust me, it didn’t fly much this year. User 13: Looks nice! Maybe a hanging plant? User 14: * Plants do wonders to give a room some more life. I would either put something large in the corner behind the TV (might be a squeeze) or on a shelf above the TV. For the latter you can go with something simple like a [LACK]([URL] and put some plants, books, memorabilia, pretty much whatever. * Putting up proper curtains with a curtain rod that runs all along the wall will help make it less of just a white wall, when it's open you will cover them and add some texture. * I guess getting rid of the carpet is something you can't do, but I get that they're a thing in other countries even though I personally hate them and have never seen them where I live. * The purple lights are a fun thing as a student, but if you want to have a cozier feeling try to have multiple smaller light sources with a more yellow light. A floor lamp next to the couch is an option, something like a [ALÄNG]([URL] would look pretty good and is $40. * To make the TV look less like it's just plopped down next to a wall something like a [LAPPLAND]([URL] is a bit expensive if you're low budget ($150), but it makes it feel more at home and also offers some storage space or room for plants and lights. User 2: Better than mine. Just saying OP: Yeah so the apartment only has a light in the kitchen and the dining area. I don’t have a ton of room for anything more than what’s pictured, a lamp any bigger than a desk lamp would have to be set in an odd spot, hence the TV in front of my fireplace. So at night I either have the aforementioned lights on with the LEDs that everyone hates (I get it, but for now, I dig it) or I just set the LEDs to white and use those as a minimal light source. User 2: Get your boots off the carpet. OP: They usually are, I just got done cleaning them so that's why they're there. User 2: Other than that maybe a small end table with a lamp for the end of the couch 🤙 User 15: Cubs fan eh . OP: Definitely not a cards fan. User 16: Add some wallshelfs! Just stick them on your wall with tape (sticky at both sides) and put a little plant on top User 17: keep it basic. minimalism rocks!\n",
            "User 118 - e6l39z Original Post: Any ideas on how to decorate the space underneath the bed? (Dimension of the spaces is H95xL62xW55 cm) Image: a bunk bed and stairs in a room with hard wood floors. User 1: I would make it into shelving and then add some sort of curtain, like a giant bed skirt, that could cover it up when not in use! User 2: I was thinking storage space too, otherwise it's just wasted space!  Either shelves or some nice big toy boxes (I assume it's a kid's room?) OP: Yep I was thinking about a storage space as well! Unfortunately, I don’t want the room to appear too messy (I like clean and simple) and I’m not nifty enough to build something myself. I was looking at storage boxes but can’t seem to find something that has the perfect size for the dimensions of the space.  And nope it’s not a kid’s room! I want to make the room appear less like a kid’s room too lol. I think painting the bed frame white would help a lot but I actually don’t want to sleep in the paint smell. A friend of mine helped me build this bed to make use of the higher part of the room so I would have more space for other stuff. But it ended up looking like a kiddo’s room ahaha User 3: Could you turn it into a low long book case? Maybe your friend can help create something that works with the existing structure under there. I feel like if you go the painting it white and adding storage will only compound on the looking like a child’s room problem you’re having.  By making it a book case, you can add beautiful coffee table books, some curios or cool-looking, non-childlike things. The bottom “shelf” could be a drawer that pulls out for storage of sheets and such. User 2: Ah okay, my mistake! The bed looks short but perhaps it's just perspective. User 4: Perhaps you could use sheets of plywood to create two sliding doors so you can hide your stuff without ruining the clean lines of the room. User 5: I would put a nice taller plant on the stairs landing to make it more mature User 6: [IKEA Storage Drawers on casters]([URL] Just take a tape measure to IKEA, find this type of style, they have many variants of size/width. Get 3 of them. Has a much more “finished” appearance for adult space, and easily hackable, paintable, different handles etc OP: Thanks! I saw some IKEA hacks when I was looking for inspiration. Really bummed me out that I didn’t know about these hacks before because I would have definitely altered the dimensions of the spaces between the legs of the bed to it. Vice versa is a bit harder lol. User 7: You could use it as a clothing organizer? Attach a pole then hang some stuff. Or you could buy a shoe rack organizer or built your own then put in inside. If you dont like the mess, cover it up with curtain. OP: I quite like this idea! Thanks :) User 8: Related? bc clothes? I have a similar little nook in my room (built-in desk possibly sized for children) and I keep my laundry baskets in it. Keeps my laundry looking neat and pre-sorted which is super useful User 9: Hang icicle Christmas lights and put a mirror on the wall at the back. Would look really cool and give you mellow lightning. OP: Thanks for the suggestion! User 10: If you add a headboard, it will make it look more like an adult's room. User 11: Really surprised not to see bookshelf suggested already.  If you have books this would be the perfect way to display and store them! OP: Yep I was playing with this idea in my head too for one of the sections. The storage space might be a bit too deep for it but I think it would look quite aesthetically pleasing.  Another idea I had was putting a big and two smaller plants within another section.  So many possibilities but I’m scared that it might end up looking really chaotic once it’s executed! User 3: Just now seeing someone else suggested this, too.  A lot of the replies you’re getting are going to look messy or sloppily executed. I wouldn’t rush to a solution on this, especially when you have such a cool raw product here. Make sure it’s done right. I think the book case idea is really solid. I would pay someone for a custom solution for a room like this.  Edit: words User 12: Little tension rod curtains, storage behind. Get some really fun bold fabric, or perhaps a tapestry you can divide into 3 panels. User 13: Rolling carts.  [[URL] User 14: Could you build in drawers? Or closet doors to hide shelving? I can also see classic pull down shades working in a pinch if you wanted to hide things behind. Great space saving idea! User 15: I would paint everything a fresh white (and the walls for a freshen-up) so it looks built-in.   Honestly, I think you guys need to redo the steps to have four of them for safety, going the whole width. It looks dangerous stepping down with no hand rail when you're half asleep in the morning. I'm not kidding. I would faceplant. (And add a handrail on the left!)  You could do two matching dressers/chests or bookshelves on the sides and a tall wicker clothes hamper in the center cubby, or two wicker hampers and one is for laundry, the other for storing out of season clothes and linens. I like the \"plant on the landing\" idea.  Edit: I would also add an interesting sconce or hanging lamps or something. [Idea.]([URL] User 16: Definitely drawers. It would eliminate the need for a full sized dresser. Consider three or even four tiers, with a fourth being for EDC items you want to hide away (keys, wallet, etc). User 17: I’m so sorry! I just assumed! But hey, build a stage or play shop anyway, release your inner child! OP: Hahaha no worries! I found it quite hilarious actually, especially since I already mentioned to some of my friends irl that it looked like a kid’s room. But yep defo going to get to release my inner child! User 17: Get a large screen, console & beanbags instead! You deserve it! User 18: my friend put a drum set under his bed lol User 19: I know you've already said you're not handy at all, but these might give an idea about what might look good, or at least more 'adult'.  Something like these [Scandinavian style drawers]([URL] you can also see how much better it looks without the bumper, as another user mentioned.   You could also get rid of the steps and put in recessed stairs [like this]([URL] (ignore the child, lol).  A cheaper option could be [cabinets like this]([URL] (sorry about the Aussie links, it's just what comes up when I search).  Or shelves [like this]([URL] I found these just by searching for various dimensions that kind of match yours, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find something similar/better.  Your setup really does have the potential to be a beautiful and more grown-up space. Lots of luck! User 20: A couple monsters maybe? User 21: Shelves and then paint everything in the same colour as you paint your wall. This way it will all come together and look more adult. User 22: I immediately thought shelving and drawers! Especially if this is a kid's room! User 23: Maybe put a cabinet door over 1 or 2 sections and convert the remaining to shelving or if you have pets a dog / cat bed or feeding station if you like. User 24: could use are storage or a back board for a desk maybe? User 23: A fort User 23: I had a bed like this! I would put clothing storage under this or just storage in general User 25: hmm storage space idfk User 26: Bookshelves with storage behind. User 27: Maybe a tiny chair in the middle. And shelving on either sides. One for books one for toys User 28: Add cool lights! User 29: I would be cupboard doors on the front and a rail inside and store clothes and shoes User 30: book shelf User 31: That is either a tiny bed or a big room User 17: Depends on the kiddo and their interests. My first thought was sweeping curtains to make a stage for the dramatically inclined, or a counter and a fake shop for pretend play? Yes shelving and cupboards are practical but so is a fun bedroom! OP: Haha unfortunately it’s not a kid’s room! It’s mine and I’m a full grown adult lol. I really wanted to make use of the higher part of the room to save space and a friend of mine helped me build the bed frame. Unfortunately it looks a bit like a kid’s room now and I’m not handy at all so I’m looking for a way to make use of the space underneath without making it look like a mess and also hopefully make the room look less childlike. I have tried looking for storage boxes but haven’t found any with the perfect size. User 32: I hope your prison sentence goes well. OP: Lol thanks! Prison would at least be free\n",
            "User 119 - pbg253 Original Post: [Request] What to do with the picture rail and the wall above it? I love the green but it doesn't sit well against the white. Image: a room with an intricate ceiling and a green wall. User 1: Can we get a picture of the area from a bit more far away? OP: Absolutely, [voila]([URL] User 1: Oh wow that's so fabulously retro.  Are you able to change the green for white? Also I'd fill that space with framed pictures or photographs and turn it into a mini gallery OP: For some reason that green revives me so the whole room will be that colour. The rest of the family aren't that keen but they're willing to overlook it (out the window, haha!). I do like the idea of filling it with imagery, I'm a fan of chinoiserie and would love to stencil on birds and plants, maybe a village scene but that may be pure fantasy.  Actually, I'm a determined fan of [Grayson Perry]([URL] and whish I could create my own homage to his work within those panels, a kind of modern day chinoiserie scene. So instead of villagers collecting water there might be commuters wearing face masks. One project at a time though. User 2: Are you painting the green on the wall? If so I might suggest a more saturated green. That one is a bit washed out. That old style of moulding and picture rail could be left if you chose either a more jewel toned, or pastel green. The one pictured is too much in the middle. By going to either end of the spectrum, the white will be either a subtle accent or a statement look. As it is it's both too much and not enough contrast. User 2: A lighter sage green would work with those curtains(?). OP: Those curtains... those curtains are not staying. User 2: I mean I wasn't going to pass judgement but I can tell you I'm happy to hear that 😂 OP: I know what you mean about the green, but it just so happens to be my happy colour, no idea why. Your evaluation is bang on, it sits just between where you'd want it in term of contrast.  I might spray paint the picture rail gold or add lincrusta panelling with gilding. User 2: To be honest I think that might be a bit overkill with the gold. I would instead find a much brighter cooler white and repaint it. Your gold accents would pop and you'll be able to have your green still. OP: If you could name a bright cool white as a starting point I will bake a gingerbread man and sacrifice him in your honour. User 2: Get baking. Snow day, Oxford white, pure white, and Chantilly lace are some ones to consider. You should be able to order swatches to place next to your green, see if you can get extra large ones too. You'll want something that's not literally perfect white, but not ivory or eggshell. Look for the word \"cool\" in the description. Also check online, most of their websites will have a function to recommend colors that go together. Find the one closest to your green and let it generate the white for you. If you can get the samples you can color match it with your choice of paint at your preferred retailer.   [URL] OP: I think this may be the most economical option. So you're suggesting painting the ceiling, moldings and cornicing in the same white. I never paid much attention to the different shades of white before, but this green makes brilliant white just seem 'undone.' User 2: Not brilliant white but one with a cooler undertone. The green you have Has cooler undertones so the creamier White isn't providing enough contrast. It's making the white look dingy. Using one with a green, blue or grayish undertone as opposed to a pink or yellow undertone with make the green look brighter. A super bright white isn't what you need either. Just cool version instead of yellowy. OP: Ah, I see. Our local paint merchant has a wall of colour swatches, I'll go and take a few to 'measure up.' Thanks for the explanation along with the advise, it shows that good style is more than taste alone. User 3: I love the green. Also this is a truly incredible room. I think a creamy white would look great on top! [Here]([URL] are some good ones! I think the key is getting that cool piece on the ceiling all one creamy white color (or another solid color). User 2: It's already a creamy white and doesn't look spectacular. A Cool white will make it look much more fresh and bright. User 3: [Right, but]([URL] User 2: Very true. My suggestions are mostly based on established color theory rather than opinion though. All paint colors are mixes of others, and the subtle differences resulting in the second and tertiary colors used in them produce the miniscule differences our eyes are able to detect, making things look \"wrong\". The fastest way to make disparate colors look good together is using similar saturation and undertones. If this green had more yellow undertones I 100% would stay with the creamier White. As it is, it used a cooler base in it's mix so a cooler white will make it stand out more. The amount of clarity and saturation of the green also isn't in harmony with this particular white. Check out Maria Killiam. She can explain it much better than I. She teaches a whole class just on shades of white. User 3: Ah yes! That woman wrote the book on making money off of color theory arts schools have taught for a hundred years through the power of registered trademark. If OP likes cool whites, I hope they try that. If not, I hope they like what they pick. I think that’s the thesis that underlies all interior design: is this a place that makes me feel good and safe? Then it’s beautiful User 2: To be fair you don't have to pay her money to get the gist.  And it's a hell of a lot cheaper than art school. *Note I went to art school not her classes. I just found her rhetoric to be helpful discussing color theory with people that haven't taken a class on it. No need to fork over cash to read her blog. But I agree that OP hopefully chooses something that makes her happy. User 3: Can the picture rail just also be that awesome green? OP: Yes, another redditor said the same thing. I never considered it at first but now I'm stroking my chin. User 4: Paint the rest of the wall the same green, paint the ceiling a darker shade of green. Then paint your picture rail gold to match the rest of the smaller trim, but paint the ceiling trim the wall color and the accents on the ceiling the same green as the ceiling. Really make a statement. OP: Oh wow. You don't hold back. That is bold. Especially making the cornicing, or ceiling trim, the same colour as the wall. I'm so used to white ceilings extending down to the picture rail. I'll have to do a bit of research on Pinterest to see how that looks but I like the sound of it. User 4: I normally wouldn't go that bold, but sometimes you have to pay attention to the architecture you have. All of that trim work is asking to be dramatic and glamorous.   You also have to look at what the previous paint was trying to do and what you are trying to do with the room. The old paint is painted this way to make the room look shorter (I'm guessing this is an 8ft ceiling room at least??). The suggestion I gave you will actually make the room look taller.   Also coloring over most of the trim work to match the walls and ceiling will actually help to mute them down and help them blend in with the room. Right now, I feel that they stand out. With the picture rail, if the gold is too bold for you, you could opt to instead paint it the same color as the wall.   Oh and I saw comments to change the green and I wouldn't do sage (not to crap on those responses). Sage is a modern/contemporary color and this is no modern wall. I would stay in the same family of green or darken down to an emerald green/forest green if you feel you need to change it up. OP: That's some really interesting insight and I love how you're taking the character of the property into consideration too. I'm going to save that to my notepad app incase I lose it.  You're right about the height, the walls are about 9-10 ft.  It's stalled at this stage for so long I'm now removing myself from the decision process; that's what's brought me here. Already I'm regretting not finding this sub years ago.\n",

User 2: Agreed!   What color is it?  Been looking for a similar blue. OP: Thanks, it’s called Denim Drift by Dulux User 1: Something like “Scandinavian Blue” depends on the brand of the color. Probably has no Pantone Equivalent because mostly is a designer color and not a basic one User 3: Personally I would just get some nicer, quality, wooden Venetian blinds. The white slats fit the aesthetic of the room and the feature windows nicely. Curtains may shrink the space a bit and hide the nice window plus you'd probably need custom curtain rails and curtains User 4: No shutters on a bay window is a crime! Granted they are waaaaaaaay more expensive than anything else in terms of window fixings.  Presuming a UK Victorian terrace, it has a ton of potential, I’d get rid of the cream sofa / fireplace OP: Haha good point, but I worry that shutters might block out more light than the current aluminium Venetian blinds? possibly make the room seem a bit smaller... but no more than curtains I suppose. I will have a good think about that.   I think the main reason I’m thinking curtains, is because they’ll block out the light from the back of the TV (it’s one of those Phillips Ambilight TVs). Currently even with the blinds closed it looks like I’m having an full on rave from the outside when it’s dark! I think curtains might offer a bit more privacy in that regard. Also hopefully curtains would help to keep the house warm in the colder months.  You are right, UK house, early 1900s.  The cream sofa and fireplace both came with the house, I do need to replace those eventually! User 5: [My old lounge]([URL] looked very much like yours. I got shutters, but cafe style ones so only up to the window opening. I wasn't overlooked, but I think you have windows on the opposite side of the road that could see in with that style so maybe best to go all the way up.   They don't block as much light as you'd think. If you're south facing and get the sun shining through the window you can angle the shutters so all the light reflects off them and hits the ceiling - lovely and bright, but also with privacy. It didn't work out too much more expensive than a really nice pair of curtains and curtain rail.  Regarding the ambilight I think you'll always struggle with it in that position as you have multiple different surfaces behind it. It's most effective on a single colour wall, which you can probably get in the alcove, but would limit the size of TV you can have. I'm sure you probably know that 😊 User 4: If you get wide Louvre shutters, they’ll block less light than Venetians usually because you don’t have so many and no string / tape mechanism. You can also completely open shutters User 6: Some would say shutters on a bay window are a crime :) to each their own! User 7: Try blinds that raise from the bottom to the top. You're street level, so you can have privacy with the top third to half of the windows open. Then I wouldn't cover the top of the window with a curtain. User 8: No curtains. Just invest in some really nice wooden blinds.   Also, what paint/color did you use? It’s lovely. I want to do something like that on the landing above my open living room, with a charcoal blue on the wall in front of it. OP: Thanks, definitely going to look into some nice wooden blinds.   The paint on the accent walls is called Denim Drift by Dulux User 8: Thank you so much! User 9: no curtains, leave as it is User 10: White User 11: Linen in a dark mustard color! User 12: yup my first though but i think nicer blinds is the better option User 13: I thought mustard too. User 14: I agree with /u/the-stoned-astronaut about wooden blinds.  If you're in the UK  try [these people]([URL] for good prices/quality.  No connection here except as a customer.  I've probably had 30 blinds from them over two houses, wooden venetians and romans.  I would say their customer service has got a lot dodgier over the pandemic but the deliveries seem to work in spite of that.  As long as you don't need help from Customer Services it'll be fine.  Also worth noting their SizeSure guarantee.  I fucked up the measurements on one roman blind and they replaced it no questions asked.  Didn't have to return the original so no faffing about. User 15: I'm willing to bet this flat is in Glasgow judging by the layout, so I would suggest a nice trendy set of steel bars User 16: white long curtains with some yellow tint or design on it would look flawless User 17: Depending on your personality, a nice color pop could suit the room well. User 18: Bright orange or marroon User 19: I would go with cream or black. As much as I like the wall color you've selected, I like a bit of contrast in the curtains. So I'd match with either the couch/chair/fireplace color or the television/tv stand/endtable. Although with the plants you could use like a Hunter Green and it would work as well. User 20: Teal. Looks like there's some in the rug to tie it in User 21: I agree with tea stains on the corner User 13: White. Silky-smooth linen. Martha Stewart has some lovely inexpensive ones.

User 1: You should make sure that your apartment complex is happy for you to decorate the external area. Many complexes deem anything outside to be a fire hazard. OP: I checked with the management :) decor is allowed so long as it is appropriate. User 2: You are lucky! We're allowed a mat and that's it. No wreaths, though people still do.   I would put in an umbrella stand under your door number. Who wants dripping wet umbrellas inside? It's the perfect space for something tall and skinny too.   Also agree bigger wreaths are better. User 3: Not sure it this something that may get taken but here are a few suggestions for the floor space under your number plate:  - Lantern (multi sizes maybe)   - Broom (aldi's sells a cinnamon one around fall)  - Large vase / jug with seasonal floral  - Small wooden crate (one or two stacked; top with pumpkin?)  - Pumkin (s) User 4: Trader Joe's has the cinnamon brooms too! User 5: Please don’t do a cinnamon broom in an apartment hallway. It’s a migraine trigger for a lot of people! User 6: The wreath could be bigger. User 7: Put a big \"no soliciting\" sign on the wall to the left. Then put a \"beware of dog\" under that. User 8: Maybe even a \"come back with a warrant\" or \"we don't call the cops\" for extra flair. All within the pumpkin spice fall color palette, of course. User 9: One I recently saw in my town: \"Trespassers will be shot. Survivors will be shot again.\"  Very welcoming. User 10: Get a small square table to fit under your unit number and place a decorative bowl with wrapped candies in it. It will bring your neighbors a little spark of joy. User 11: please don’t do this currently in order to curb the spread of covid, but it’s a good suggestion for the future User 12: A candy bowl next to hand sanitizer. OP: Ooh good suggestion!! I love the idea:) User 13: It's adorable and I love everything about it!! User 14: Layer a thin carpet under the doormat, maybe black and white stripes, I always love the way that looks! User 15: Looks nice! Maybe add a larger thin outdoor rug under your door mat. Very trendy right now to layer the door mats User 16: Damn.  I'm always late to the trend 😂😂 User 17: Hello,  Why is it trendy? What makes it trendy? User 14: Pinterest makes it trendy...  Why?  To sell more rugs :) OP: Thanks! I might try that (: User 18: Love the mat, I have the same one User 19: I love how festive it looks! I live in a condo complex and I also have a white front door that I decorated recently. I got a burlap wreath similar to this: [URL] Mine has purple flowers on it, which I thought would make it a good year-round wreath when there’s no holiday. I wouldn’t normally gravitate to burlap, but the wreath is big and lush and warmed up my white door pretty nicely. Wreaths can also be expensive, so having a default is cost effective and an easy choice. OP: I appreciate your input :) this is my first place and I didn't realize how expensive decor can be- especially wreaths! I love your burlap idea User 20: Hey, I think a side table ranging 18 to 20 inches high just at the left corner may look good. You can also place a small flower plant over it which will look better.  Let me know if you might need some handmade handcrafted wooden end tables or side table suggestions. OP: Hey guys! Decorating the outside of my apartment. What else could I add to spruce up the decor game a bit? Thanks in advance! User 21: Put a pumpkin under your number! Change it to a poinsettia for the Christmas season and a nice plant for all others. User 22: Where is the doormat from? OP: Hobby Lobby! User 23: It’s feeling a little matchy matchy with the brown/orange mat plus the brown/orange wreath. Maybe try dried greenery for your wreath instead? And I think the wreath is a littttttttle small for your door.\n",
            "User 123 - dem8ai Original Post: Need help with a paint color choice! Should I do another coat of this peachy neutral, or do something a little lighter (closer to white?) I’m going for a boho vibe with pops of rich color and I have one wall that’s all natural wood! Image: a bedroom with a window on one wall and wood wall paneling on the other side of the wall. User 1: I think the color looks nice from this one picture, but admittedly I'd probably feel differently if it was my own space, and if it was a small room with not a lot of natural light. I think a bigger contrast between the gorgeous wood wall and the other three walls would be fantastic.   The thing about white paint is that it REALLY opens up and brightens a room. My thing with beige and peach tones in a darker room is that after a while I start to wonder why I chose bandaid colored paint. But that's a personal thing. It can be really lovely and cozy and minimalist if done right, and it does sound like you know what you're doing with that color scheme. I love colorful rooms in general, but the house I live in right now is pretty dark, and after choosing to paint my living room white I couldn't be happier. It made such an enormous difference in the brightness and overall feel of the room. And colors can always be added in as accents. I've got a lot of green plants, wall art, and throw pillows.   What it really comes down to is the style you want. If you paint it white, I see more of a bohemian or Scandinavian influenced design, but with peach walls I see chunky throw blankets and string lights. Both colors will look good with wood accents and sharp lines. OP: Thank you so much for this!! I totally agree - something was bugging me about the color and now you’ve totally nailed it, it’s bandaid beige 🤣 it was actually an old gallon I had laying around the house so I’m not losing any money going with a new color!  In your opinion, should I do more of a bright, pure white (like the ceilings?) There’s also white trim around the room that I’ll be painting over, so I wasn’t sure I should completely match the two. I was thinking something like this:  [URL]  But now I’m worried it’s a little too beige as well. Any input is much appreciated!! Thanks again! :) User 2: Maybe you could do a tinted white so it's not stark white walls on stark white trim? My roommate and I just painted parts of our house this color   [URL] The online swatch doesn't do it any Justice tbh. In person the walls have light blue  or lilac  tint depending on how the light hits it. The baseboards stand out from the walls giving it a Morocco vibe, which goes with the boho aesthetics. It's still fairly white, so it's not overwhelming either.  Obviously you don't have to go with this exact color. OP: Ooooh, I like that color! Definitely going to add it to a list with a few more options to sample out on the wall. Updates to come :) thanks all for the help!! User 3: I’m not a huge fan of wood tones and browns to begin with. I think they get outdated really quickly.   Besides that, too much in a small room is going to be dark and make the small room look even smaller.   If it were me, I would paint that wall white. I’d also get white shelves instead of more dark anything. Brighter will make the room feel larger. OP: I totally agree! I wanted to paint the wood wall white originally and go with a color, but the parents won’t let me so I’m stuck hahah. I’m thinking of doing a bright white like you said and just accessorizing with some small plants that won’t take up the space! User 4: I thinkt that would probably be your best bet at making the room feel bigger too. Then you can add all your color in bright accessories and plants! User 3: I understand completely! Plants will help. The white wall will help. There are a lot of white plant pots that mount on the walls on Amazon. Maybe Mom and Dad will allow those on the wood walls?    Maybe keep big things like furniture white and add colorful accessories. OP: There actually are already two hideous wood shelves on the wood wall that I’m taking down and I have to put something up in their place since they’re going to leave some damage! They’re cut off in the picture but I think they’d be the perfect spot for some white shelves or plant pots. I’ll definitely post an update :) thanks for your help! User 3: You could chalk paint them white if their shape is acceptable. Can you add some other images of the room? You might get more suggestions and help.  I look forward to seeing your update! User 5: Personally, I’d go with a nice, bright white for the wall. Maybe a yellow curtain on either side of the window, but put the rod all the way up next to the ceiling.  How big is the room? OP: That sounds like a good idea! Big fan of yellow so I’m down. I don’t have the exact dimensions, but it’s just about big enough for a full bed on the wood wall with a small nightstand on either side. There’s just one more window on the opposite wall (not pictured here). User 6: Where will the pops of rich color come from if you’re planning on going with white or beige walls? I personally like bold color choices for paint. I recently painted a small room in my house blue, which is basically the same shade blue as painters tape. It sounds awful, but it looks really great with the natural wood moulding, blinds and floor. The ceiling is white. It might be fun to paint one wall a rich shade of your favorite color and paint the other walls white. If you do go with a bold color, be sure to get the paint from a paint store such as Sherwin Williams or Benjamin Moore. Their paints are more durable than paints sold at non-paint stores. OP: For reference, the room is super small. I have a beige fabric bed and headboard that’ll be centered on the wood wall with some floating shelves (either gold or black) and I want to incorporate some rich velvet colors, like deep greens, blues and reds! Maybe a vibrant rug for that pop of color?  I’m leaning towards an off white color for the paint rather than the color I have now - any recommendations? TIA! :) User 7: Somthing peachy/ pink might be nice User 8: I would go for a bright WARM white.   I actually am digging the wood wall.   If you’re looking for inspiration I highly recommend going to apartmenttherapy.com and putting ‘Melbourne’ in the search bar. I find nearly all of the posts from there are bright boho with pops of colour.\n",

Then just put a few beautiful or interesting things in there like small paintings or photos, shells, rocks etc. Colorful things would be nice. User 2: Get more books :) User 3: Get rid of it? OP: I have this super empty book shelf in our living room but I don’t have any more books to put in it, I have another bookshelf in my bedroom. Any ideas of decorating stuff out other? 😊 User 4: Picture frames and a small potted plant would work. Also I’ve seen different ways of stacking books that look really visually appealing (like sorted by color or in small horizontal stacks) that might help. User 5: I’d take out one or two shelves so you can space them remaining further apart. Then you could place larger objects on it.  Maybe put some cool patterned peek and stick wallpaper on the back and paint the rest a coordinating color. User 6: You can buy ceramic decorative items from a thrift store and spray paint them all the same color User 7: Mason jars where every time you open a bottle of wine, the cork goes in the mason jar.  Start with 3 or 4 and fill those bad boys up!  That only fills up half a shelf but it's still half a shelf. User 8: Photo frames maybe User 6: I think hard cover books look better without their jackets. You can just store them somewhere\n",

User 1: Add a rug if you aren’t opposed to the idea and move the shelving unit more towards the middle. User 2: If you’re a sew-er (or want to give it a go) you can make some chair covers in the fabric or fabrics you want and slip them over. Also good for cleaning purposes! OP: Thank you! Thats a great idea! User 3: I would center the table and bookshelves on the wall and then add similar decor on either side, maybe a plant in the corner. User 4: Add something to the wall, maybe a big mirror, and remove at least 30% of the stuff on the bookshelf User 5: I would replace with some modern chairs and put a rug underneath. OP: Do you have suggestions for the chairs? User 5: it's really difficult without seeing the context of the space and the wood properly. If you want to get wood tones you've got to make sure they don't clash. I mean I started looking here but you've got so many options, it depends on your budget and current surrounding style and taste. Three examples [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  I think it's imperative that you get a rug for under set too. If you're not on a budget I'd just get a new table too or you could sand that one back for a more natural look which will update it. User 6: Consider rearranging things on the bookshelf. I think it would look good to alternate shelves of books vs shelves of decorations. It also is a good idea to put them in some sort of order, maybe a range of color or height, and all standing up. You could use one of the vases as a centerpiece for the table as well. And as someone else said, center it behind the table User 7: A colorful center piece would help too User 8: You might want to add some accents on your chair like having this one [[URL] plus accompany it wall decors on the side like having a [3 panel blue wall art]([URL] and just an opinion also, I think you need to invest also on your shelves OP: Wow I didn't know those accents existed!

Post an update when you have the rug in :) User 2: Worked for a Persian rug dealer-  Such great basics in your space! The creature in your space looks a little wild and untamed. Is it housebroken? Looks like it could ruin the furniture, so get performance fabrics.   Your bank account won’t thank me, but this exceptional space deserves a very good quality rug in a natural fiber. Either classic or modern would work with the room, just make sure that the rug is enough of a neutral colour that it won’t overwhelm. Also, make sure the rug is big enough for the room,-many people buy rugs that are too small for the room-which is why I recommend shopping in person with an experienced rug dealer.   If you’re not interested in a project and just want something to cover the floor, then just get a big, off white rug. Sisal and jute look great but a bit cold on the feet unless you live in a warm climate.   Good luck-would love to see an update with your new rig. OP: Thank you so much for your response!

Also the dark part is actually a deep navy blue Image: a women's skirt on a rack in front of a closet filled with clothes. User 1: Something like this. [URL]  You need to pick a color on the skirt and get a top in that shade.  Satin, silk or a polyester will do best.  Cottons are to casual.  There is really a ton of options. User 2: I agree with this, you should stick with that navy blue or one of the greens so it looks like one whole set, but you could probably get away with going for one of the other colors of the skirt like that pink/red it just might make you look more Christmasy.  A boxy cropped shirt would also accentuate your figure with that skirt. User 1: Agreed! 🥳 User 3: Try a white or black top maybe?? That way the focus is on the skirt User 1: Don’t do this ⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️ User 4: Satin emerald colored cami. User 5: I would say a tight top, same colour as the dark blue or the green of the skirt, with an interesting neckline but without any prints. User 6: If you can find the right colour, a fitted body suit! Rule of thumb: don’t wear baggy with baggy! Opposites attract 😍 User 7: Turtle neck (color depending on what time and place ur wearing it) or an Anthropologie styled button up.

User 1: Having a long line of stuff on the wall facing the bed is stressful looking.  So move stuff around so that wall looks less cluttered and junky.  Move your sneakers somewhere else. Hang them in shoe rack behind closet door or in a bin under the bed but get that clutter hidden and out of view.  For now I’d try the book shelf between the windows? Will it fit there?  Or move the tall mirror there?  Perhaps get rid of bookshelf or that storage thing?  Not sure what will work in your space but move stuff around so that wall is not just random collection of clutter and mess? OP: Great advice, thank you! Moved the shelves between the windows, storage (laundry bin) and sneakers into the closet.  Looks a lot better User 1: Will you post an updated picture? Then we can give suggestions for next round of improvements?  I’m thinking you should center the dresser with the bed. Perhaps find cool way to hang your skateboards above the dresser as both storage and decor? OP: [[URL] (updated) - obviously different lighting because - later.  They're snowboards.  I could also potentially hang them in the hallway going to the room (long corridor).  I do like having them out User 1: Definitely looks better. So I’d find something to hang above the dresser. Good art or bunch of photos or round mirror so think of something there.  Or on the now big empty wall. A photo gallery wall making sure to have some touches of blue to tie into your bed would look great.  I’d also think of getting rid of floor shelf lamp. Replace with matching or close to matching nightstand and lamp to better balance out the room.  Yes use your snowboards and find way to feature them. They are cool and would add person to the room.  What is on other side of dresser tucked away? OP: Its box of clothes that i'm getting rid of not permanent.  I'm trying to figure out what kind of art to hang. It feels like a big blank wall, and tough to consider what to put there. User 1: Go on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist in your area. See if there’s anything you like. And keep checking and I’m sure you’ll find something.  Sometimes it’s much easier to say yes or now rather than go through a big search to figure out what you want. User 2: Headboard for the bed, big rug that goes partly under the bed and artwork between the windows and on the right hand wall. OP: Any recs for headboard material? Rug color?  I guess the only thing not replaceable is the dresser, User 2: A dark wood to match your dresser would look really good especially with the dark blue bedding. I personally wouldn’t go for a fabric headboard as they can mark and wear down far faster than wood/ metal. User 2: Don’t go for a rug with too much white as it looks dirty if you’re walking over it a lot. A pattered rug of different blues, blacks and whites would be nice to add some interest to the space. User 3: What's your budget?  Totally agree with other poster, I think you have too much *stuff* visible that it makes it look cluttered and busy.   I would do a low and wide credenza/dresser across from the bed, and hide all the stuff. [Dresser]([URL] if you need more clothes storage, something like [this]([URL] to hide shoes and other stuff.  The bookshelf can go on the wall with the bed\n",
            "User 134 - bep2r0 Original Post: Any suggestions on adding to my new apartments living room? Image: a living room with sofa, chair, television and chair. User 1: my shower curtain is nearly the same as your tapestry haha User 2: Colorful prints, some rich drapes with swags, and plants with large leaves. OP: I do have a pot with a dead plant from my roommate and we haven’t decided which plant to get that has big leaves. What color of drapes would be a good choice for this room? User 2: Something with a bold jewel tone. Your room is so pale that it’s washing out the earth tones, and so you need something like a royal blue, maroon, burgundy, forest green, or goldenrod yellow to bring color back into the room in a masculine-leaning way. OP: I will definitely look into a royal blue. Would bright or light purple be good or no? User 2: I’d use royal purple or something in the plum family. The bright purple might be a little shocking against those earth tones and that magnolia paint.  That being said, it’s up to you to determine what colors work or don’t in your space. User 3: I think that tapestry would much better if it was pulled super tight to fit the space between the doors.  Use a bunch of flat white tacks. OP: Unfortunately it’s about 2 1/2 inches shorter than the doorway to doorway length. The top is pulled tight but the bottom hangs and I still need to steam away the fold lines from moving. User 2: Maybe build a wood framework for it? Make it seem like a huge canvas print? OP: I never thought of that! That actually would look awesome. Thinking like a dark cherry? User 2: Or a medium walnut, both would look nice in the space. User 3: Yeah, either use a blue-grey from the tapestry, or choose a contrasting color. User 4: You can buy some wallpaper that looks pretty much identical to that cool tapestry you have on the wall User 5: dont put a rug on a carpet.  :)\n",

            "User 137 - scj7gp Original Post: How to do my hair with this dress? Image: the back of a brides wedding dress showing the waist. User 1: I haven’t had my wedding yet so I can’t speak from experience, but style-wise, I don’t think you can go wrong here! Your dress has beautiful detail at the top so a full updo wouldn’t make it plain at all. The straps are also thin enough that wearing your hair all the way or half down would look beautiful as well. Does your hair hold styles like curls very well? Do you plan on dancing and moving around a lot on the big day? If your hair doesn’t stay curled and you plan on doing things that might make you sweaty, an updo would be more practical. Do you wear your hair in a bun normally? I forget what youtuber it was, but someone recommended to have a more glamorous version of your go-to hairstyle on your wedding day. You’ll feel practical and familiar but beautiful. OP: Need help with how to do my hair with this dress. I have long-ish thick hair that goes to about the middle of my back, no bangs or anything. Dress is Maggie Sottero Charlene.  Wedding is in June so I wondered if it would be better to have an updo to avoid having all my hair down on my neck/back and being hot. It also seems more practical to not have to worry about touching/adjusting an updo like I would with long hair. Also my hair tends to frizz I humidity, so that's another worry of having it down/half up half down. I do like the half up half down styles but like I said, not sure it would be practical or end up actually looking good.  Will my shoulders/back look too bare with an updo and all my hair up? Or would it cover up too much of the dress to have it all down? I've also seen a lot of updos have \"pieces\" pulled out (face framing?) Which I think look odd especially on me as I don't have short layers or bangs.  I'd love to incorporate some type of braid (even small ones/hidden) but again, not sure if this would be the same concern as leaving my hair down.  Has anyone had summer weddings with hair down and regretted it/how it looked afterward? I'm so stuck on what to do! User 2: Down and wavy! Then later in the evening you can throw it up in a loose pony if you want User 3: Hair up. It’s cooler, will keep you looking fresh.  Will also elongate you. Seems to go with the dress. User 4: beautiful! i vote hair up. sounds like you have long hair, which would make for a gorgeous updo, and you won't have to think about it at all.\n",
            "User 138 - vqrpoc Original Post: Any tips on what I can do for this space? I feel like the carpet really limits me. Image: a living room with a couch, coffee table, tv and shelves in it. User 1: You could always buy an area rug to put over portion of it. User 2: Don’t let the carpet bother you. Get a fun shag or patterned rug for the sofa area (at least 8x10, not too small!) User 3: Rugs.com is having a big sale right now and they have cute stuff. User 4: I’ve found that boutiquerugs.com is fair as well User 5: The carpet is definitely stealing the show in this room right now, which is probably pretty frustrating especially if you don't love forest green.  But, don't despair! There are definitely ways to help balance the green and give a more complimentary look.  A few things that might help:  - Get Retro. Look for inspiration from time periods where forest green would have been trendy colours, like the Mid Century Modern trend.  - Match Jewel for Jewel. Select another jewel tone (or two) that will help balance and compliment the green. Warm tones like red, pink, purple, orange and yellow are all good bets.  - Light Well. Lighting is always good for mood setting, so take a look at floor lamps, wall sconces, etc, to help brighten the space.  As others said, you can also definitely layer an area rug over top of the carpet. It can help define the living space and you can use it to tie the other jewel tones into the room as well.  Have fun! Sometimes having something tricky to work with can make the design experience more fun. User 6: Warm lighting might even make the floor look less green by cancelling it out a bit.  I’d experiment with that some if possible User 7: Personally, I would lean into the carpet if you can't get rid of it. This gives me a forest fairy/cottage core vibe or you could pull off a midcentury modern look. The coffee table already fits, you can buy legs to put on your couch to match it. Get some more atomic looking decor/art and a retro lamp User 8: I was just going to say they should embrace the carpet and put some mcm decor in the room! User 9: I agree, embrace it if you can’t change it! I have a dark green tile in one of my bathrooms. I ended up doing a peel and stick wallpaper that was jungle/leaf themed and doing gold accents. It’s one of my favorite room transformations in the house now lol. I can’t stop suggesting Nuwallpaper, they offer a lot of patterns and have high quality wallpaper that doesn’t peel but it also doesn’t damage the wall at all when removed. The right wallpaper can set the course of your room even if it’s just an accent wall. User 10: I hate carpet and looooove this carpet!! You definitely can make this room very cool. I would go very light warm tone furniture and decor - like beige, whites and natural woods. Look into tiki aesthetic like rattan, bold artwork. Task lighting is going to be inportant so don't skimp. I woukd go with a very narrow cteam color palate and natural wood. It will look amazing. User 11: Get a really large jute rug to put on top of the carpet and neutralize it as much as possible.  Like an 8x10 rug  Your friend has shared a link to a Home Depot product they think you would be interested in seeing.    [URL] User 12: Get some pool ball bean bag chairs.  (Kidding, but also not kidding) User 13: You want the art nouveau look. You've already got the carpet, the ceiling fan, and the wood furniture. Get a lot of fancy looking lamps, change the curtains, be more deliberate about the things you hang on the walls and bring some of that furniture away from the walls and into the room. User 3: Install a curtain rod that's long & high enough to cover the sliding door blinds. Then get some patterned curtains that can compete with the carpet & create some visual interest.  ETA: The tapsetry would look nicer framed. You can make a cheap frame by adhering the tapestry to foam backer board with spray adhesive, and then make a wood frame with [moulding like this]([URL] to go over it. Home Depot will do cuts if you bring measurements. Wood glue should be sufficient to join the wood. User 14: Yup, that green carpet really stands out. Only way to settle it is to make it look like an indoor forest! Put down a rug that looks like a creek with stones. Tack fabric to the walls that look like trees and vines. Or mountain scenery! Freestanding lamps that have flower blossoms around the lights, tables that look like red mushrooms, mushroom pillows, use antlers for decoration, stone inlay desk, tree stump and log decorations. The fabric you already have up is the right idea.  Go all in! User 15: Gotta rearrange the double layer couch. I’d also move that table with the box fan on it, the way it is, it’s blocking off the room. User 16: Get a large area rug! User 17: some plants and greenery might compliment the carpet well. then for stuff on the walls im thinking incorporate darker shades of yellow, muted coral colors User 18: Putting green? That’s pretty bad, lol. I think an area rug or 2 is your best bet User 19: Velvet furniture in emerald/navy would be perfect. User 20: I would totally layer some area rugs in here, then you could just have green carpet peeking through as an accent color!   You can often find nice inexpensive rugs thrifting or even buy some cool carpet remnants from a carpeting place and add some backing where needed.  I can’t really tell how high the pile is on this carpet but if you don’t mind a real cushiony floor you could do it even if it’s a deep carpet, just make sure to occasionally lift rugs with furniture sitting on top or in high traffic areas and give it a vacuum every so often to keep it fluffed up User 21: Pink and green are great together. ❤️ User 22: The room is a bit dark feeling. I love the color of the green, but definitely break it up with a lighter colored rug.  Add some lamps, a couple accent colors that will go with the green. (I like terracotta with dark green). Put some lighter colored artwork up. The dark art against the dark carpet and dark couch is a bit much imo User 23: Yup, too dark but not in a good way (there are dark black/blue or green rooms that are absolutely stunning). I like the carpet though, it gives a lot of room to play with decor. If op can get rid of something that would be the two dark wood bookshelves / stands on the right. They look outdated/out of place and makes the space overloaded. Sofa and light wood table seem ok. This space has a lot of potential and pretty sure will be easily improved softening the colour palette and adding some cool items. I do suggest using natural materials (like light coloured rattan / bamboo) and adding golden / framboise touches for a happy finished look User 24: Carpet lowkey coolest thing here, would maybe lean into the green and what happens there instead :) User 25: I know this is a boring suggestion but a large cream rug with some kind of patten would work well here. User 26: For the carpet if you can't afford to redo the floor you might be able to take a few area rugs and cut them up like best dressed does in this video: [URL] User 27: yellow looks good with green. velvet too. maybe aim to get matching shades of wood, curtains, and either a brighter couch or bright throw pillows n blankets for that couch. decluttering would really help and fixing the droop in the wall decor blanket  edit also warm lamps User 28: I would lean into a 70s vibe, peel and stick contact paper. Bright orange couch cover.. funky 70s crap everywhere lol User 29: I don't know if anyone here believes in Feng Sui but the color of that rug is stressing me out. It's too much of a strong color for a rug. If you can't replace it I agree with the others about getting an area rug to cover most of it.  Good luck! User 30: Removing the carpet is easy, if u aren’t renting. Just pull up a corner to see what the subfloors are made of and if it’s good wood you can turn it into a wood floor space, if it’s not good add some paint!   Or some nice area rugs could be a smarter choice, too User 31: I’d lean into the green and put up some of that peel-off wallpaper stuff in a leaf print as an accent wall. User 32: I think if you work with the carpet instead of against it you’ll see great results.  First of all, if you can, I’d get a lighter couch. If not, a white throw blanket.   I think the darker wood of the bookshelf looks really nice with the carpet. Maybe a coffee table in the same wood.  Framing your artwork is cheap and easy and will really pull it together and make it feel more polished! User 33: Putting green User 34: Paint the ceiling lighter blue  , draw your eye away from the green User 35: i LOVE the carpet! sure, on its own it feels kind of “heavy” but you can brighten up the space for sure! area rugs that add pops to the floor itself, depending on your budget maybe some more “funky” furniture and decor. not sure if you would be down to commit slightly to a plant, but adding some snake plants would be a nice way to fill up some of the lower wall space. if you find a good sized one, they don’t need much attention besides lots of water every once in a while (and some kind words here and there 😋)   again, i’m not sure what your situation is like so if this isn’t an option forgive me! but changing the ceiling fan could make a HUGE difference. even just painting it to add some personality. i would maybe move some furniture around so it feels more open, but of course i’m not sure what the dynamics of the room are so if this is what makes the most sense keep this overall layout.   another thing that my brother and sister in law do in their upstairs space (the “game room” / brothers computer area / shmoking room 😶‍🌫️) is pinning tapestries along the ceiling. the lights are SO bright with the white ceiling up there, the tapestries sound like they would look awful but in my opinion it added a lot of personality, and also made the room feel much more cozy and “home” like. User 36: Go minimalist. Get rid of accessories/ decor. Add jewel tones accents or natural accents. Keep it simple User 37: I like the movie room vibe, but if you put the white couch where the dresser thing was so that you had kind of a conversational pit? Can we have some more pictures User 38: Move from white walls to cream and then start incorporating things with brass.   Look at this picture for color scheme inspo    [URL] User 38: The white in my pic looks white but it’s definitely cream User 39: Maybe use the green to your advantage? The green could be fake grass and you could somehow turn the floor into a “field” of flowers or something? Put a mural of a tree on your wall or lots of plants and flower in pots…I know it’s not the answer you want but I would try to incorporate the color somehow.  If that idea isn’t to your liking I agree that an area rug or two would help. User 40: The carpet is strange but I kinda like it.you can tell it's clean and it reminds me of a pool table :) User 41: I’d get a rug or some pillows that compliment the rug and also get warmer/cozier lighting. User 42: Anything that has to go with golf would go good in there User 43: Oh honey I’m sorry but it makes me want to book a tee time. I would use a neutral colored room size rug. Nothing with brown in it because it will then look like grass AND dirt. User 44: Is there another sofa behind the sectional? User 45: Seems like light is lacking… I’d get a big mirror to lean against a wall to increase the feeling of light in the room.   An area rug, for sure. Maybe something light in color with green accents in it?  Potentially matching colored slip covers (light color) for the couches. The room just feels dark to me so I want to brighten it up.   Cute throw pillows for the couches.   Look at Target and TJ Maxx/Home Goods/Marshall’s/At Home/IKEA.  The dark wood furniture may not look too bad if you go with lighter fabrics on your couches, throw pillows, and area rug. Otherwise, the dark wood feels outdated. User 46: my favorite part about decorating is adding a bunch of small lil items to the area, like candles, books, vases, etc! User 47: The carpet is literally the best thing about this room. User 48: Mini putt putt course.\n",

User 1: I like the rug and the mix of vintage and kinda modern look of the space.   Unsolicited suggestions though 😅.    - I would mount the tv on the wall and put a plant on top of the console and some ornament ( that globe on your great looking coffee table, books, etc.)   - I would change the curtain to a longer one and a pair ( I’m not quite sure about it but I can see it working on the space) I think it will make an illusion that you have a bigger window and would also hide the cord.   - I would also put a floor lamp beside the art piece so that it accentuates that area, especially, that it has a big wall post there.   - I love a room with a plant or two, so putting another one beside the sofa would look good and maybe also on the coffee table. 😉  Overall, the space is looking great. Def, something that I would prefer living in. I like the aesthetics of the floor, the open brick wall, and the revealed tubing below the ceiling. 👍🏻 OP: thank you so much for your advice! lots of ideas i wouldn’t have considered on my own! i like the idea of mounting the tv, it’ll be a fun project! User 1: You’re welcome! It’s always fun to recreate a space that is your own. It’s even more fulfilling doing it yourself.   Good luck on making it a more comfortable space for you! User 2: I’d suggest finding a way to hide the cord on the wall near the window, and something to fill the space over your tv (like a bright piece of art) would look rad OP: haha yeah i definitely need a power strip. and thanks for the second artwork idea, i never thought about about that! User 3: There's something really off about that curtain, it looks like a shower curtain.  I'd figure out a different window solution. User 4: To maximize space (or the appearance of it), id say look into mounting the TV, adding some light/white coloured accents (I.e. sofa cushions, throw blankets, Art, books, shelves, whatever), and in the longer term, go in the same direction with your tables and tv units User 5: Agreed about the curtains. You should aim for them to skim or touch the floor with about an inch of fabric. Your ceilings look like they might be pretty high, but you can find panels that are 96 or 108 inches without too much trouble! User 6: This room has a lot of potential! Just throwing a few ideas out there:  If you're able to paint, I'd paint the brick wall a very light grey while leaving the column white. This would add a little contrast to the room and would compliment the pops of color you have even more. The wall behind your TV I'd paint a bright white and as another poster recommended, I'd try mounting the TV and place some accent shelves.  I absolutely adore the design of the curtain, but unfortunately for me it feels far too short. I'd go with a length that hits just about floor level as it'll define that corner of the room and make it cozier while also hiding the outlet cords.  I'd also love to see a hanging plant or perhaps some lights from that incredible black pipe/beam.  These are just some random ideas, but I'm excited for you regardless of what you choose to do. :) User 7: I love your rug and it's nice that you've got a different shade if pillow, you might want to add some wall art in here which is like something like [this]([URL] and by the way you might be planning to have a floor-length curtain and some plants in here\n",

User 1: Remove wallpaper, paint a pale neutral, keep drapery, replace flooring with something mid-tone neutral (ideally hardwood, deep walnut brown stain), paint fireplace mantle white. OP: Thanks! What do you think in regards to the fireplace? I was thinking of buying an iron cast Victorian fireplace and fitting it in the space as I think it would match the nice hardwood floors eventually, or what would you do with the fireplace ? User 1: Would it be possible for you to post a close up of that tan surround material? Can't tell if it's stone or what...? Would retiling it, and the hearthstone, be possible? Can you replace the electric unit with something more attractive, like a glass-front one? The Victorian idea might work, but it can look corny or cheap if not done well.  I'm making these suggestions for resale, but also i feel you have a lovely room and too many elaborate \"improvements\" would wreck the feel of it, whether you sell or not! OP: Sadly no close up but hopefully will be in my hands within 3 weeks or so...  I would rip all of that out and maybe keep the wooden frame around it but the Victorian fireplace would fit in the space perfectly as that is what would of been originally there before the boiler fireplace.  Appreciate your input!   Also what colours would you go for have any in mind? User 1: Yes, maybe keep the wooden surround. If the floors get changed to dark walnut stain, I’d match it to that. White or pale tiles perhaps for for stone surround and hearthstone too.  The drapes are the right length, and they look nice from here...velvet? That would certainly set a tone.  Walls could be just a simple Bone or off-white. Not sure what colors are called in UK, and what paint companies. But if for resale, don’t do anything kooky...keep it pale on the walls. OP: Thanks for all your replies! I’ll let you know how I get on eventually! User 2: It’s fantastic as is though! With the right furnishings, it is such a classic space. OP: It’s a really cool house hasn’t been decorated in a long time it’s like stepping back in time. I’ll take some before and after pics to show everyone when I’m done! User 3: I'm not sure if this is in your budget but this room would look gorgeous with wall paneling. OP: Ooo that’s a good idea, any examples of what you’d put on and colour ? User 3: Since it's Victorian I'd say keep a kind of classical look; remove the wallpaper and keep the walls a cool or pastel tone. Some simple white rectangular paneling, like [here]([URL] would probably look nice. Honestly, you could probably keep the wallpaper too, I think paneling breaks up patterns very nicely. OP: Thanks for the inspiration! Think the purchase will be dragged out for a while due to U.K. lockdown but we’ll see will update you when u can! User 4: I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:  - [/r/designmyroom] [I posted a little while ago and got some helpful comments!

Or are you going to live in it for a while? If just for resale, I'd say to paint in a neitral colour and re-carpet/ laminate floor. OP: My idea was too rip up carpets and sand, varnish etc the hardwood flooring, I was going to buy a Victorian fireplace spruce it up and install it they’re only about £20-£80.   I’m just unsure on the wall colours as I want to avoid cream as it reminds everyone of renter accom and I want it to feel homely as it will most likely be sold to a family  I was thinking maybe a grey feature wall and like a sort of white on the rest maybe?\n",

I have a 35\" waist and 45\" hips with a tummy and the size 14 fits nicely. I usually prefer a high rise but these fit like a mid rise and still look really nice, so they're really versatile pants. Good luck! User 8: Cropped boot cuff jeans, a white dress shirt open low and a black velvet vest that fits close to the body. User 9: I'd go with flared jeans and a buttoned shirt (if it's cold wearing the shirt over a turtleneck).   These boots are \"just\" black boots with a little bit of interesting texture, no need to be nervous about styling them. They would look good with almost anything! Have fun 💜 User 10: A mustard yellow long sleeved turtleneck, with dark navy blue high-waisted slim pants and a thin white leather belt. Together with a chunky white necklace of some kind. User 11: Black skinny jeans or leggings, a white or otherwise clear top. Dangly earrings and jewelry same color as the stars (I can’t tell if they’re silver or gold). Giving me Howl from howls moving castle vibes! Love it OP: the stars are gold! : ) i don’t have a lot of gold jewelry but i definitely need to change that haha, thank you for the suggestion! i totally agree that they have howl vibes ❤️ User 12: I'm thinking high waisted pants dark or pattern pants and over sized white shirt? Accessories could be necklace, some rings, maybe a hat, any that you think would fit the outfit idk. Those boots are sending me! Gorgeous! Also im just throwing suggestions, I'm no fashion lady :) OP: wide leg raw hem cropped jeans ! With a denim button up ! And a skinny silk scarf tied in a bow under the collar User 13: They would go with so much .. anything form a skrit or dress to jeans or leather pants . Dark bottom , light top with those.    Ps. Can i ask where you got them ? I love them… <3 OP: they’re from urban outfitters, but i believe urban outfitters stopped selling them! i got my pair off poshmark : )\n",

User 3: I love Alexander McQueen. It’s definitely a statement piece. User 4: I’m a huge fan of the style. I know the style of some on here is to be matchy matchy and I respect that, but don’t let it sway you away from a bag that you like. I agree with you, black goes with everything. I wish we saw more less traditional bags like this on here! User 5: I love McQueen and feel like this is a good representation of the brand. OP: Thanks! User 6: Same. Super cute User 7: It doesn't want the homeless to sleep on it. Sorry 🤣 it has an edgy, punk rock aesthetic that would be perfect with the right outfit but it just reminds me of hostile architecture. User 8: I think it’s very lovely. User 9: That’s beautiful and badass! I love it! User 10: I’ve been eyeing this myself as it’s one of my favorite brands. Go for it! User 11: It's lovely but  I'd put an eye out and rip all of my clothes.   LOL User 12: Love it! User 13: Do it sis! User 14: It’s wicked, edgy and punk rock! Love it 🖤 User 15: Love McQueen, got the sequined version of this one to have as a glam/evening bag and I love it! User 16: Love it. It’ll go with any outfit. Go for it! User 17: While not my style, I like that it’s a edgy and fun. User 18: I feel the studs and skull together are a bit much and giving an expected look. They have the bag in quilted blue and yellow with the skull and a bunch of other that contrast more with it and are more exciting for me personally. If you want to stay with black they also have one with rings attached that’s even more edgy. Also a designer handbag should be an “omg I love” purchase as it’s not a practical purchase but one to have fun with User 19: I've been looking at this one too! I love it even though it's very different from my usual style. If you get it please update us on the quality :) I don't have much experience with designer bags and need something like this in terms of size and style. I was curious about the quality of McQueen bags. User 20: Do u have a lot of outfits to wear it with or is it a collectors piece? OP: I have a few in mind but I can’t imagine it would be very hard to find outfits to match as the bag is black User 20: It has an edgy look to it. I'd say go for it if you'd wear it a lot. OP: Thanks! x User 21: I personally don’t care for the skulls but if you love that sort of gothic steam punk vibe then I’d say go for it. User 22: I’d choose other options for sure because it’s too edgy for my style, but If it isn’t for you, go for it! User 23: How much is it? OP: Around $1,770 (Australian dollars)\n",

The slender silhouette will juxtapose a more loose-fitting pant and if the cut is at the ankle or above, will make your ankles look really delicate.  Bow off.

User 1: Plants User 2: The answer is always plants OP: That’s a great idea! Bamboo does well in indirect light so I think I’ll get some bamboo. I’m buying a bonsai tree soon (I just haven’t found the right one for me yet) so maybe it will sit up there too! User 3: Pothos plants, too! I love my pothos and they managed to survive through my last apartment which had direct light for about 1 hour a day, for 2 years. Just from your photo, I can tell you had more light than I did in that place. User 4: Bonsai do best outside iirc. Go for a Christmas cactus or another indoor low light plant instead. User 5: Depends on the species. If it's a tropical species it'll probably do well inside. If it's a decideous plant which grows in a more seasonal place there might be issues. User 6: Orchids do well inside User 7: Where do one go to find plants User 8: Your local nursery User 9: I've only bought babies there User 10: The plant nursery is way cheaper. User 11: Facebook marketplace too User 12: Came here to say this! Plant , plants, and more plants. User 13: Can you move it away from the window?  I don't like the look of blocking the window with decorations. OP: Yes, We decided we are going to switch my bed with my bookshelf so my bed will be in front of my window. Just not sure what types of decorations should go on it. Thank you! User 14: It's difficult to recommend decorations without seeing the placement of the shelf in the overall look. You will need to experiment until it balances out. For example, try the bottom shelf with large coffee table books lying flat and stacked in the centre or off centre.  On the next shelf up, perhaps a grouping of three different sized vases or combination of tall vase and stouter round glass ornament or bowl, off centre. Perhaps nearer the top lower candles, smaller book stacks and a small plant / cactus. Play around until it is visually pleasing. Don't jam up the bookshelf with stuff. OP: Thank you! I hate a bookshelf that is too full. I bought this from someone who had a serious movie collection and the shelf had just completely lost its beauty.. lol OP: Ignore everything else pictured, I don’t have my room *exactly* put together yet. I want to see what types of things should go on a bookshelf. I have a bunch of books and am buying geode bookends for them. I’m interested in the 70s, retro, etc... User 15: Cool shelf! Some options:  A) You have a statue, vase, plant,  matryoshka doll, [Barrel Man souvenir]([URL] Dundee Award, etc. that is awkward or unhappy in its current placement, or is languishing in a box of keepsakes somewhere. Something that you have always intended would have a place in your forever home.  B) A bar.  C) There is something on your wishlist that you didn't have a place for before. Get it.  If you don't have any such thing, I suggest you just wait until one falls into your lap, or you see something you just have to have. Or maybe ask a parent or older relative if they have some fun keepsakes you could display? Things have a way of accumulating, so I would avoid buying something you don't love just to fill the space. OP: So funny you mention a barrel man! While I was cleaning I found him and thought hmmm.... what a silly thing to put on my bookshelf. Lol! User 15: I have a couple on my bookshelf as well! OP: Some air plants in a glass jar or vase. Framed photo. Candles. Small statue/figurine. I’m not one for “live,love laugh” type quotes on a piece of painted wood but whatever floats your fancy. User 16: One of those ivys in a pot that cascades down, some succulents, books,  interesting looking glass vases or glass art since it’s in front of the window (goodwill is usually full of these for cheap) OP: I’m actually growing elephant bushes right now! They’re succulents and they grow like crazy and can cascade down. Once they’re in full form I think I’ll put one on top! User 17: Actual hamsters. User 18: a nice hour glass always gets me going User 19: 👏🏼 User 20: It's so cool! Look around your house, what items do you already have? I wouldn't go out and buy a bunch of department store decorative stuff to put on it, but I would start with what you already have.  It will take some moving things around to get a feel for what looks nice. Do you have books? Some of similar shape or color? Can you arrange them stacked on top of one another? Maybe 5 or 6 tall depending on how thick they are. If that doesn't look right, maybe you can get some cool book ends and arrange similar looking books together in groups. I wouldn't do too many in one grouping. What else do you have around? Jars or baskets? Cool plants, rocks or artifacts? Put them on the shelf and see what you think. I'd start there. OP: Take out shelves and stand and use for excercise wheel for your cat. If you don't have cat get one. User 21: One of my friends has a great shelf like this! Hers is from World Market. She has a a few clusters of books, picture frames with photos of friends/family, some plants (a trailing one would be nice), and maybe even a lamp? This is such a beautiful shelf! OP: The one from world market is my dream shelf! but it’s $400.. so I found this one on Offerup for $180.. and guess what? It’s the one from World Market! Lol I got soooo lucky, and it’s huge!  I dug up this oil lamp from our garage today (for decoration- not functional) and I think I’m going to set it up there. I’ll post a picture when It’s decorated! User 22: Bonsai! User 23: And a sword User 24: a record player would be nice to have and a tiny modern/zen-looking lamp as well. cacti and other plants would look great! User 25: A hamster plush User 26: Hi!  I almost bought that same planter/shelf because I love the design but held off because I was worried about the cat turning it into a giant hamster wheel.  Does it seem stable to you? OP: Yes, it’s very stable and quite hefty! User 26: Awesome.  Thanks! User 27: I think a large hamster would go really nicely here.  Or perhaps a chinchilla? depending on whats available locally User 28: It needs a hamster User 29: You seem to have a lot of plastic storage bins and other types of storage around the room. In addition to some plants and books, you might want to put some decorative baskets or containers to hold some of the items in the bins and then discard the bins.

Like others said, play around until it makes you happy. OP: Whatever you have that’s a round...

User 1: I like the jacket, but depending on your body type, the dress might look a bit off. You might need some waist emphasis OP: Yes thats for pear shape User 2: Yeah this will look way off for pear shapes. We have wider hips and narrower top halves. Waist emphasis is crucial for us! OP: You can wear belt and define your waist but still you didn't balance upper and lower proportion of the body the shoulder still narrowband hips is maybe wider   you just cut it in half Thats my opinion User 2: Not sure what you mean by this. User 3: The jacket is perfect. I would look at shortening the dress to over the knee because the boot will make your legs look shorter. OP: Yes thats true! User 2: Tips from a petite pear:   * Add more waist empasis to the dress. Look for something shorter (at/above the knee) and with a belt or cinched waist and a gentle a-line or fit-and-flare silhouette. This maxi length sheath/shift dress will make petite pears look swallowed up and blob-like.  * The ankle boot is going to cut and shorten the leg on most petites. Either opt for a black boot and pair it with black tights, or go with a shoe with a lower vamp.  * The jacket, too -- cropped is cute, but the straight crop will probably just make the entire body look as wide as a petite pear's hip, and give the illusion of being overall wider and shorter than you already are. Instead, look for a cropped jacket that nips in at the waist and gently hits the high hip, adding more waist emphasis to the look.  * The bag is perfect. Love it. User 4: Looks awesome! I like the association of the different shades of green and a note of blue with the bag :) User 5: Looks great! User 6: I love that jacket and the shade of green. User 7: Where is the jacket from?

            "User 147 - dtykmy Original Post: Any suggestions on making this room look better? I feel like something is off. I am not sure where to start. Image: this living room has a lot of furniture and a dog bed in the middle of it. User 1: The layout of the furniture is super awkward looking.  I assume there is a TV over the white cabinet with the stained top?  If that is the case, I would put the longer sofa under the window, the shorter sofa under the three windows and put the white chair to the left of the window (facing the three windows, not lined up with the sofa).  That would be a much more natural arrangement of furniture.  Beyond that, you definitely need art and need to stop adding little knickknacks to the space.  But fix the layout issues before you do anything else. OP: Thank you! I was thinking the same thing about the awkward layout of the furniture. An actual home designer did this. It’s been a very frustrating and expensive experience. I’ll try that layout! User 2: That's ridiculous User 3: The above arrangement makes more sense. That chair could also go out from the couch under the windows and kinda angled for the tv. Just gives a couple options. Other than wonky layout? Everything is too low! So art, mirrors, tall bookcase to pull the eye upwards.  Edit: after looking at it I think the issue is the designer makes it look more staged. You need functional and live there. User 4: Depending on the rest of the layout of this space,  I might consider moving the tv to a lower piece of furniture underneath the windows and moving all the furniture as the person above me suggested but rotated 90 degrees so one couch is under the big window and the other is facing the three small windows and then you could put a narrow console table behind that couch. Also, I saw in another comment you were thinking about replacing the flooring and I would suggest just continuing with the hard wood through the living room and get a nice big patterned rug. User 5: I do think the suggested layout makes more sense but I don't feel like there's any room for artwork with all these windows. I think that would just make it look cluttered. Also, I don't think your knickknacks look bad or cluttered at all (though I guess if you got a bunch more they might).  I think a longer coffee table would help as well as a bigger tree. OP: By the way, the couches are the same size. Would you still recommend the layout you suggested? User 1: yes User 6: More dogs! User 7: Weird angles. Move the couches to line up with the walls User 8: I think the particular choice of styling for the furniture and accents (curtains, lamp shades, carpet) all combine to make it look like the lounge of a retirement home.  The carpet, sofas, and curtains all really bother me - especially all together like this. OP: I laughed so hard at your comment. I agree. But help me out. I can’t exactly burn my house down and start over lol. My forte is...not design. So I hired someone with great reviews, and i think she made it worse. User 8: No worries.  I think the room itself is good, those 3 windows are actually pretty cool.  I would consider replacing the sofas with comfy leather in a darker shade (black or darkest brown).  Choose an accent colour scheme (2 or 3 colours that look good together, probably a light, mid, and dark shade) - whatever is your favourite and don't be afraid to choose something bold, it's for accent not dominant. Choose curtains and throw cushions in that colour scheme and in a style of your choice, and that should give you a good foundation to build on.  From there you can add accent pieces like lamps or other decorations to suit your taste.  I think the very mundane colour scheme of the current room is really what kills it, and also just realizing that the couches are all different colours - that is certainly adding to the strange, not-really-home feeling of the room.  The grey carpet will be fine if it's matched with a cozier couch in a contrasting colour and less lacy curtains.  The \"modern rustic\" coffee table and side-runner should also match the cozy dark leather couch suggestion just fine. (I'm pretty sure it's a side-runner anyway, we only see a small edge of it on the far right of the photo.) OP: Thanks for your input!  These are new and pricey couches, I would prefer not to have to replace those and just work the room around them.  I think the beige chair needs to go and I totally need different window treatments on the main window, what would you recommend?  I thought I could do some kind of accent color velvet chair(s) as well.  I am hanging some art below the 3 windows, they need to be adjusted but here is what they look like: ([URL]) User 9: Those pictures look great!  I agree with rotating the couches to line up with the walls, and perhaps something else to bring your eyes up, such as a hanging plant in the corner where that tree is, a taller tree, or even several hanging plants across the front window. User 8: Hmm, those couches and carpet combo are really not doing it for me personally.  Those are nice art hangings though.  I think the couches could be balanced by much darker flooring, but area rugs on carpet is kinda weird.  I would sort out the carpet / couch situation before choosing window treatments, but I think a darker colour would work well to add some coziness.  I feel like I keep suggesting \"darker colour\" because everything is a pretty neutral shade and I think offsetting that with a darker shade would give a sense of coziness. User 8: Maybe a simple starting point is to rotate the furniture so it lines up with walls, and put a dark area rug in the central area under coffee table? OP: Ok, new carpet is definitely doable and we wanted better quality carpet anyway.  Love that idea.  Do you think a charcoal-like color would do it for new carpet color? User 8: Yep, I think charcoal would fit perfectly.  Less worry about stains that way too.  Building on that, darker or mid-shade curtains would probably do nicely - but I would wait until after the carpet is replaced before making final decision on curtains. User 10: Are you trying to sell? If you are, then the neutral colors and lack of decor are good so that people can insert themselves mentally into your home.  &#x200B;  If you aren't trying to sell, ask for your money back. All the neutrals blend into each other, and not in a good way. Get some stuff at different heights. Lamps, art, pretty literally anything that will give an impression that a family lives there and not some kind of museum caregiver. User 11: Yeah! Go to a local art market and find some cool pieces you like - invest a bit in your space. Maybe there are some bright throw blankets you can toss over the back of a couch, or maybe a slightly less retirement home-like lampshade you can stick on your lamps. Target has a lot of inexpensive decor if you're not sure about finding some really weird stuff. And definitely add some more greenery! User 12: I think a big, colorful area rug would warm it up some. It feels a little cold to me. User 8: I agree, that carpet is bothering me so much.  Especially combined with those sofas and curtains. User 12: To the left of the cat, is that an opening to another room/door outside? I had a room just like that. I helped to put the back of the sofa facing that with a sofa table behind User 13: “To the left of the cat”  made me chuckle. Thanks for the giggle!! OP: Yes to the left of cat, there is a small dining area and sliding glass doors going out to the porch. What do you mean by sofa table behind? User 11: Not enough dogs. :>  For real though:   Put one sofa under the big window and one along the three windows, then move that white chair over to where your two doggos are and put it on an angle facing kitty-corner to the corner with the tree. Your lamp table can go in the corner where the tree is, the tree can move to where the cat is, the dogs can move to where that brown side table is, and that table can find another home entirely. Your furniture is all fine - it looks like nice quality stuff! The placement is just awkward. :) User 14: You have some good advice in here already about how to rearrange the seating to make more sense, and I see that you are considering changing the curtains out for something darker. Other than that, a floor lamp would be a nice addition. Can't quite figure out where to put it until the furniture is all moved around, but having at least 3 different places for light helps bring a room together.   Dark blue curtains might look nice if you pull the blue from the throw pillows and add some pieces in the room that match it, for example the table lamps or a throw blanket on the white chair. User 15: I actually like the couches. I think new carpet (or at least a rug) and new curtains would make a massive difference. I’d paint the walls a lighter and brighter shade too if possible. I think you need some texture (texture carpet, textured throw) to add some visual interest too. User 16: I didn’t read any of the comments but it would be super nice if you had some color. Maybe a nice yellow or a deep red? User 17: If i may ask what brand the couch in the middle is, or maybe both couches are? Looks like the kind i want OP: Both couches are through the manufacturer \"Craftmaster.\"  I would just go to their website and browse their fabrics, I chose a high performance fabric because I have pets.  The couches have a herringbone design on them too. User 18: Move the plant from behind sofa, and move it against wall where the cat is.😃pretty furniture! My favorite style.

And going along with the layout change someone else mentioned (can't remember their name, but you did reply to that comment already). It just feels like something is missing in the center. But on the bright side, I also think your place really only needs minor changes :) Best of luck User 21: Oh, and a taller plant in the back would probably help too! A hanging planter might be cool if you want to experiment with that. Either way, adding more greenery, whether fake or real, would be a big help. User 22: I'm going to try my hand at this just because I was looking for this subreddit for a house we just bought.    The arrangement of furniture is odd I've drawn a suggestion.  And you can view that in the link below.   With that suggestion a sofa table behind the love seat would be great and then a larger coffee table.   The big miss in here is a lack of color. It's beige/brown overload and it all needs broken up a bit.     Curtains like what I have with the suggested layout would look great! [URL] User 23: I just feel like the walls are bare and could use some art or photos. User 24: Large dark jade green pillows and a large plant. User 25: Angle the sofas to the wall. I like the lack of clutter. Just a little art work for wall. Less is better in my opinion.  No junkie nick backs. User 26: There's a lot of negative space.  You need more dogs. User 27: It's the angle that the two 3 seater couches make. It doesn't quiet look right. Just try moving them around or taking one of them out of the space. User 28: I'd add a few more pets to the mix. That would make it look REAL cozy. User 29: I'd move the couch to create a separation between the wood floor room and the carpet room. Then I'd put the other couch at a straight angle as well, against the window. I think I like the chair where it is.  The coffee table feels too small for the room and for the furniture. A way I might remedy that without buying a new table is to push it closer to one couch so it doesn't look like all the furniture is sharing the table. User 30: Oh my dog, that room looks like heaven to me.  It's beautiful and full of dogs!  Can I come over?  (and I don't think the furniture is awkward at all.

User 4: I think some light curtains might help make the space feel a little more cozy.  Maybe it's the angle of the photo but the rug feels a little small for the space.    Painting the walls a warm neutral might also be a nice touch. OP: It’s a rental so I can’t paint the walls but I’ll definitely get some curtains, thank you! User 5: Put the curtain rod high not right at the window top.  I also think a much larger rug that you can get the front of the sofa on and the front part of those two chairs will make it all seem together . Well ... second look.. maybe that rug edge would be too close to the Tv stand and the (?) fireplace edge like that .  Maybe just a larger rug but not that large User 6: Nothing but curtains, in a warm shade maybe. It's already a very nice room, congrats User 7: Curtains are a great suggestion! As is a larger rug- I would incorporate some color into the rug too. I would also suggest framing the art. Love this space- those green chairs are awesome! User 8: How about more ambience lighting?... OP: I have been looking at floor lamps actually thanks for the suggestion! User 9: Go for a larger rug, move the coffee table to be a side table and get a larger coffee table or ottoman. User 10: curtains and a MUCH larger area rug with color and  pattern. the chair will always be statement pieces  and the rest of the room is pretty nuetral so any color for rug and curtains will work!  I agree a floor lamp will help too. OP: The current rug is 5x6.5, what size rug do you think would work? 6x9? User 11: I would get a much bigger rug--I think it would make it seem warmer. I echo the recommendation of curtains, too, for the same reason.  Also, I like the coffee table, but the lines of that design don't say \"comfort\" to me. Does that make sense? OP: It does make sense! Thank you! User 2: Maybe an end table for the couch and of course many more plants, especially if you can hang them or get something for height. User 12: You’ve got an odd mix of things here, but it can work. You need to frame those posters. They’re cool and modern, but those two chairs (which I love) are pretty old-fashioned.  I think this can work if you keep in mind that you are mixing two styles.  I think somebody mention teal for the curtains, and I can see a solid teal curtain working well there. You’ll need to have teal somewhere else, two or three places, but they don’t have to be big, maybe a thread in the rug and one teal/turquoise vase.  Nice room. Unique and cozy. User 12: I wouldn’t go for many more plants. The trend now is a lot of plants, but that’s just a trend, and people go overboard. Less is more in my book.\n",
            "User 150 - hae1z6 Original Post: Does the line rug look okay????? Opinions please. Image: a bedroom with a black accent wall has a chair and a bed in it. User 1: I would prefer the rectangle rug to be straight not at an angle with the bed but that's just me! User 2: I don’t mind that at all. It’s out of the box but not in your face. OP: I tried but unfortunately its a 5x7 and it was too small the next size up was too big so I tried to use it somehow. Thanks for the suggestion though! User 1: The rug looks plenty big enough to either be straight across the end of your bed or have one rug on either side of the bed. Or place under bed stretching to under chair with white rug on top User 3: [URL] I’m confused. Is it because you wanted to layer the rugs? Seems like graphic 1 applies. OP: So your picture was the original plan but the rug was too small. I was trying to see if I could make it work before having to return. User 4: Yeah, angle is off-putting User 5: I did the same thing in my nursery. Personally,I like it. User 6: Love it! The pattern and the angle.   Do you have a pad underneath to prevent it from curling up/rolling/etc?  Now you just need some really amazing art above the bed. OP: Hi! I do. Its a velcro rug pad and its a pain to install so I figured I’d tried it without it in case I had to return it 😅 User 7: Ruggable? Fair warning, they never fit the same after the first wash... The corners curl and they shrink a bit, so it’s insanely difficult to put it back on (even with two of us!). They even replaced our first one and same issue, although the 2nd one didn’t shrink as much. But we will keep being Ruggable customers because our dogs. OP: Same here! I have a Golden and a Black Pit Mix. But thanks for the warning! Maybe I’ll wash with cold water and air dry in that case and hope it doesn’t shrink. User 7: We got ours when Ruggable first got big, like only had a few patterns, so it’s possible the issue is fixed! We did follow the washing instructions exactly. We just position it in a way that the side where the pad will stick out is what’s under the couch. One plus is the dogs love rug switch day. They like to roll all over the fresh rug while we are trying to even it out 😂 User 8: I’m a newer ruggable customer. And nope, the issue still persists. I just hide the short side under my couch too. But my dogs love the rugs so it’s good enough for me. User 7: Ah that’s a bummer! Their customer service blamed it on me and said that only an inch should hang off. I was like I get that but there’s not even that much... we’ll I’ll still be buying them for my dogs too! Just wish they would make the rugs a tiny bit bigger. User 6: Don't return it. I love it! User 9: Because your colour palette is fairly muted you can use a lot of different textures! I think it looks great User 10: Love it User 11: Yes I love this! Also where did you get those throw blankets?? OP: The sweater blanket  [URL]   The throw on the bed   [URL] User 11: Thank you! OP: The one on the chair is super thick and cozy 💕 User 11: It looks so cozy!! I’m buying that one for sure! User 12: I love it too! User 13: What paint color is that on the wall? Love it! User 14: seconded would love to know User 15: Love the rug, and I really like that you’ve placed it at an angle. If it were me though I would pull it towards the door a little more so the faux fur doesn’t overlap it. OP: I’ll definitely try that! Thank you User 16: ID on the bed frame? User 17: Where is that bedframe from? Love it! OP: Thank you! All Modern.    [URL] User 18: Love it. Just makes it stand out a little more. Sometimes I get far too obsessed with symmetry and this is a nice touch. Out of place but not out of place. OP: Thank you 🙏🏻☺️ User 19: I am honestly curious, how is using a bed facing the window for you? No light on your in the morning ? OP: Hi! I purchased this window covering.   [URL]  The light option doesn’t let anyone see in during day time and that dark option blocks all light. Highly recommend. User 20: I love the color scheme of this room! Gives me so many inspirations User 21: LOVE this room! You did such a good job! I think the rug is perfect User 22: We have the same rug!! User 23: What are the paint colors? They look great! User 24: You need some accent colors and maybe some wall art (with matching colors) OP: Hi! I’m planning to add some wall art and introduce more greenery and gold accents. User 25: I love the rug! But I don’t like the faux fur because it distracts from the beautiful rug. OP: Thank you! I’ll play around with the placement. ☺️ User 26: Ocddddddd OP: Sorry lol User 27: The edge of the rug jutting out of the bed seems slightly off but overall it seems to blend in overall with the look. User 28: I like it a lot. I think you could show a bit more of the rug on bottom by pulling it towards the bare floor more. User 29: Do YOU like the rug? If so then keep it that way. The only opinion that should matter is yours :) (But I do like the rug) User 30: Love the rug like that 10/10 innovative\n",

            "User 1 - ye0bne Original Post: Suggestions to hide the Landlord Nonsense on my ceiling? Image: a painting of a picture taped to a ceiling. OP: My landlord is on crack or something. The white tape was here when I got here. The silver tape over it I put up to try to reseal it. Landlord danced around the question when I asked wtf it is. One thing I know is I am not removing that tape to find out. They're kicking us out after this year to let a frat in so it won't be my problem anymore. Until then, what can I put on the ceiling so I don't have to look at it anymore? User 1: Looks like a water issue might have happened where the entire piece was replaced and either it started again or made an “access” panel  What is above that area? A bathroom?  You can buy access panels depending on the size User 2: that looks dangerous. keep a paper trail of anything sketchy this landlord does in case you need it one day. User 3: I would get something like this  [URL]  Or a ceiling medallion or ceiling ring and put a battery operated or corded light fixture in the middle  And then put a destination in the corner  A bean bag or a single fancy chair underneath. Or a bookshelf, desk, whatever OP: I like it. I read about the adhesive tile idea elsewhere but thought it would be expensive/not worth the effort. Putting up just one to accent the area definitely seems more reasonable, and those tiles are cheap as hell. At those prices I probably could do the whole ceiling. User 3: I'm glad you like it!  I haven't used the website, so I don't know about shipping costs or speed, but I did see ceiling tiles after I posted on home depot's website and other's too.  But because it's foam, you could use peel and stick Velcro (or hook and loop) to hang it up and won't have to use glue and can take it with you if you want. User 4: Okay this is really dumb, but what if you take a photo of another part of the ceiling and print it, and then attach it using double sided tape?  Not what I would normally suggest, but if you're only there temporarily, it might be worth trying. OP: This idea made me cackle like a hyena User 4: Believe it or not, this is actually not an original idea 😆 I forget where I saw it posted, but I saw someone print a ceiling tile to cover a yellowing one that had occurred due to a leak that their crummy landlord didn't address. I think in their case they were able to just scan a good tile, and it resulted in a pretty convincing fix.  I unsuccessfully tried to find it, but I did come across this which might be another option to consider: [URL] User 5: I personally wouldn’t have anything touching it—you don’t wanna get blamed for new or old damage trying to “repair” it or even “improve” it yourself.  Deposit woes. OP: You've got a point but trust me - I ain't getting no deposit back. Nothing would change that. These people are straight up criminals. User 5: Then printout it is :) User 6: Tell people it's modern art OP: \"It represents the housing crisis. I'll sell it to you for a month's rent.\" User 7: Wow what is that covering??   Maybe try a ceiling tapestry, white posterboard, or a ceiling corner lamp but that might be too small OP: I don't know what it is. Landlord is crazy and sketchy and I will not try to find out myself. That tape is staying there. Might pull it off when I leave so the landlords have to explain it to the frat coming in.   Tapestry: sounds pretty. Will have to think about the details and find more inspo on here. Not sure if I'd want to have it flat on the ceiling or have it in the same configuration as the corner lamp pictures I'm seeing.   White posterboard: easiest option to just \\*hide\\* the damn thing, actually a better version of what I was considering doing to maintain the seal (just tape around some cardboard on it) 2 birds with one stone. For decor I like both your other ideas better, but I could do the posterboard then something else on top.   Ceiling corner lamp: Not sure how to do it in a landlord friendly way; had to look up pictures but the ones I'm seeing do look nice. This studio is dark af, so again two birds with one stone. Hell, landlords might not even notice. There's still nails in the wall from the last tenant.   Thanks! User 8: >Wow what is that covering??   You know I was about to ask OP if he's an aircraft engineer because it definitely looks like speed tape, used to make minor repairs on planes. 😄 User 9: I’ve seen people take light weight fabric and drape across the whole ceiling. You could go simple, solid color, boho, Morrocan, African, floral, what ever style you like. You could do one drape, no drape, multiple drape , just using staples or thumb tacks. User 10: That whole square around it aswell could it have been a trapdoor or something weird User 11: Mao Zedong OP: We may be headed in that direction. Homeless encampments are springing up all over the place here as rent continues to increase. I moved into my apt. because I could afford to not have roommates here. I heard they're trying to bulldoze this neighborhood to put up more \"luxury\" student complexes. User 12: The landlord special: Add 10 layers of old lumpy paint applied with a dirty broom on top. No one will ever notice!  But for real, maybe a 3d decorative paper thing. It would be really lightweight and you can just tape it up. Like lantern, fan, flower etc. OP: No shit! Y'all haven't even seen the worst of the paint. It's literally so bad, globbed on and chipping off everywhere. Everything down to the metal wire TP holder on the bathroom window, covered in globs. One of my neighbors/housemates/whatever didn't get the paint treatment and I'm not sure why. We have the same door/window frames and hers are absolutely beautiful. I'm jelly and I want to wring the neck of whoever did this damn paint  Paper idea is kind of neat too. More artsy and maybe more effort than the time I have, but paper lanterns are a vibe. User 5: Put a square shaped corner cabinet with a board near the top or a fluffy fake plant or basket something that blocks the view.    And ask him WTF it is.  Leak, drug stash, tell tale heart? User 13: Is that allowed? Like if you complain about damage does the landlord not have to permanently actually fix it but can make you put up with it as long as it functions ok enough? OP: Under my state's law the appliances need to be running and if AC is advertised, it needs to run below 80. This is neither an appliance nor an AC unit. I can only assume the painted-over tape came from someone else complaining about the hole.   The maintenance guy here is crazy. He doesn't speak English (no hate but it means I can't just go through him, I have to talk to my batshit crazy landlord) and I don't think he's actually any form of qualified.   When a shade thing broke in the yard he mounted it to a power pole. Crazy illegal and dangerous. They mounted it to the house instead one day, I assume because the city chewed them out.   Landlord said they'd paint the garage doors but just replaced them with some rusty metal plates they got from god knows where and bolted  together some \"doors\". They don't have knobs and only open with locks that we can't get the keys to. So they're just open 24/7. When the wind blows them closed the noise is unbelievable.  Enough to make you jump every time. I put rocks in front of them so that doesn't happen. Sometimes junkies wander in and we have to shoo them away before they take anything. My neighbor's laptop was stolen out of her car one day by a dude who said he left his bike here (??).   The screens on my window are held in a frame that's just held on the windowsill by tabs. The frames don't actually fit the window so they bent them to fit, creating a large gap and defeating the purpose of the window.   In my INSANELY TINY closet, one wall feels like it's made of expanding foam or something. It sluffs off if you rub it.   I don't ask for maintenance anymore. User 13: Damn no wonder everyone’s trying to become a landlord and get into real estate they don’t have to invest much into the homes User 14: Tapestry User 15: Is there a hole? How is that legal OP: Well, I don't really know if it's legal or not. But I need housing. I don't know what's under the tape and I'm not going to try to find out. User 15: Oh gotcha. Hope you get it documented User 16: If I were you, I would probably get some paintable, sandable spackle, and just spackle over the whole thing, tape and all, then sand and  paint it to match the ceiling. I like the DryDex stuff that is pink but dries a neutral color.   Embracing home improvement projects as a woman is super rewarding and if you ever get down on yourself and want to feel beautiful, try being a woman in a hardware store. Guys will fall all over themselves to help you and give you advice. User 17: With a mold lawsuit! OP: No clue if there's mold up there but there's definitely mold in the bathroom. I have a window not a vent so it's kind of inevitable. Took two months for the paint above the shower to start peeling back. Some others in my life have mentioned mold fuckery (I'm pretty sure the AC has mold in it too, they sent an AC guy and he sprayed cleaner in it).   The sad reality is that any housing in my budget is just going to have mold. I can't afford to pass up a house based on that alone. Plus my parents' house had mold, so it's not that new to me. That's just middle class America.   My last apartment had a mushroom growing out of one corner (on the top floor!) when I moved in. We picked it but it kept growing back until maintenance there sprayed it with IDK sauce. They only had one maintenance guy in a massive complex, but at least he knew what he was doing. User 17: Ah do you’re in Florida too lol. I had mold in a condo. Never got so much as a cold but was hospitalized twice with pneumonia my first six months there. I spent thousands trying to treat it and it ended up flooding during a hurricane, after which literally everything I owned was ruined. I often wonder if it hadn’t been so compromised to begin with if it would have been irrecoverable. If your landlord tries to ignore it, document everything and try to get out. You have no idea how insane mold toxicity can get. It’s more than just an eyesore!\n",
            "User 2 - fcjviu Original Post: I have this really ugly desk that I got for free through student housing. I'm not allowed to paint/ change it permanently because I don't own it. Any advice on how to make it less ugly? The colour really bothers me! Ps. I know the layout isn't nice, but I have limited space and money lol Image: a room with wooden floors and shelves with small objects on them. User 1: Moving the desk in the middle of your shelving would give you some more room and create a little more visual interest for your space.  For a temporary solution, you could always grab some peel and stick wallpaper or contact paper to change the desktop color. OP: Does peel and stick wallpaper not leave behind residue? (I don't know, I've never used it) Also my fear is it might start to rip pretty quickly if I'm writing on it a lot etc. User 1: I just used it for a wall this past weekend and it’s just a big sticker so i think you could use GooGone for any leftover residue.  Contact paper may be a good alternative with a desk pad over it to protect it from wear and tear. User 2: Throw a table cloth over it, and get a piece of glass for writing on. Did this for years with furniture I wasn't allowed to alter OP: oh ok i like this idea a lot! User 2: And check thrift stores for random largeish glass and the habitat for humanity restore if you have one! A frameless mirror works great too User 3: Get a cute indoor plant OP: It's also really messy but like, it is what it is User 4: Table cloth or runner. User 5: You won’t see much of it once it gets covers with books, lamp etc!! Search a local thrift store for a blotter or anything else that is flat and durable. User 6: Get a piece of plexiglass cut the same size and then you can put anything you want under the plexiglass: fun fabric, scrapbook paper, photos, etc. User 7: Contact paper over the top! They make some that’s easily removable!  Where did you get those baskets??? They are amazing! OP: ok thank you! and i got them and the shelving from ikea years ago, and i love them very much. here's the link:   [URL] User 8: You could get fun washi tape and cover the outer edges of it with a patterned or solid tape OP: oh that's a really good idea! i love this subreddit so much User 9: I put cute thrifted fabric over ugly furniture/walls etc all the time.\n",
            "User 3 - g0fdsx Original Post: Would sell my soul if that meant I could give my kitchen some personality Image: a long kitchen has a refrigerator and stove with a refrigerator and a sink. User 1: It is long and narrow, embrace that. Is there any way to turn that door into a focal point?  Add a valance to it, and something to the wall next to it – a series of small pictures, a household bulletin board, a piece of art. (Just stay away from one big picture.)  A splash of bold color in minor details might also be good. I’m a huge fan of using red as an accent in an otherwise neutral tone room, but that’s just my taste.  Dish towels, small decorative accents on the countertop, that kind of thing.  Finally, try to keep that countertop neat. Not entirely bare, but also not cluttered. It is the only flat surface in the room, so whatever you do to that surface will defined the room. OP: Thank you for this! I wanted to go to goodwill today to buy some cheap picture frames and make some art to go in them. I was considering blue as an accent color since it's a complimentary color to orange and the cabinets seem to be very orange lol  Keeping the countertop neat is doable but a struggle I'd you know what I mean lol. Usually everything's put away except for the dish rack. I just snapped a picture while cleaning. I was considering purchasing a hanging dish rack just to really keep the countertops clear. How do you feel about that idea? User 1: the dish drainer actually isn't a deal breaker - although it would be good to get one in that accent color.  one of the tricks to dealing with clutter is to make it intentional and purposeful.  think about it:  * books laying around are a mess, books on a shelf are neutral, and books on a shelf and artfully arranged by size or color look great. * shoes all over the floor are a mess, shoes stowed in your closet are neutral, shoes lined up by size in a mudroom or entryway look great. * kitchen towels balled up on surfaces or hanging crookedly from knobs and rods are a mess, kitchen towels tucked away until needed are neutral, kitchen towels \\*neatly folded\\* and laid flat beside the sink or hung from the stove handle look great.  It's all about making the things you need handy anyway (that's why they get left out) look like they are *mise en place* for your busy but orderly life.  with that in mind:  * turn your drainer sideways, so that plates and bowls are \"facing\" the sink.  someone walking into the room will see dishes desplayed, not the edges of random items * when leaving dishes out to dry, arrange them by size with the smaller items closest to the sink.  you didn't just leave them there haphazardly; you *put* them there because that is where they ought to be. * leave a dishtowel (or rag) folded *neatly* over the end closest to the sink or - if you have enought room - in the space between the drainer and the edge of the counter.   you left it there not because you are messy, but because it belongs there and you are the kind of person that has what they need readily at hand.  good luck OP: Whoa this is amazing advice! Thank you so much!!!! I'm going to go find a drainer that's a bit newer and will match the kitchen. Thank you thank you!!! User 2: If you bought some different cabinet doors you could [paint them]([URL] leaving the original to be out back when you move, and use the color as a accent color around the kitchen for a rug, art, etc OP: Oh this is interesting! I'm going to look into this a bit more User 3: I'm not sure how much you use your kitchen, but I have seen some blogs where they use contact paper on their countertops. Like [this]([URL]  I would also consider some temporary wallpaper for the back wall with the door. That would really draw the eye there and add a lot of interest! OP: I use my kitchen a looot. Heat, water, knifes. You name it. I'm afraid of putting contact paper on the countertops for that very reason actually. Im not sure how durable it would be User 3: Ah, okay then. I would't recommend it. I don't think it would last very long. In that case, focus on the far wall with the door and add a colorful runner. OP: Gotcha! OP: Anything I could do? This is a rental so Reno options are limited. I'm down for diy too! As long as the project is under 200 USD. I'd love to find a way to add more color to the room If possible. User 4: Wallpaper it!! Stick and peel wallpaper is huge now a days and from what I've read, very easy to apply and take off if you mess up!  You can either do a solid color or accent walls or any type of wallpaper that is your style! OP: I was actually looking at some on target! I'm not sure what color to go with. The floor throws me off so much lol User 4: Maybe choose a fun floor runner and then pick a color to accent the rug 😊 User 5: I’m not sure where you are but if you have an ikea check the discount section and see if you can get some cheap doors! Or failing that put a nice coat of white on the panels and some nice new handles! I OP: I'm in Arkansas lol...so no ikea for me! But I'm not able to replace my door anyway :( User 6: What are the options limited to via your rental agreement? OP: We can paint the walls as long as we repaint them before we leave! As far as the cabinets and countertops go we arent allowed to remove them or paint them. If we add things such as knobs they have to be removable User 6: It depends on your style as to how you decorate the kitchen. I'm afraid a modern aesthetic would be much more difficult to pull off with the current cabinetry. However, not impossible.  If you enjoy eclectic or bohemian style, I would paint the walls in a rich color, and add a vintage runner, maybe paint the door as well and It could function like an art piece. I think alot can be added just in the decorations of a kitchen! You can get wall decals in a large variety of styles!   There are lots of different styles, my suggestion would be to replace things like your fruit bowl or your  utensil jug, and if you have any plants maybe re pot them in pots that better express your tastes. Then, if you're still unhappy, consider painting the walls to match one or more of those objects, and look into adding a rug ( I know there are mixed feelings about rugs in the kitchen, if you have children or a messy dog or find yourself spilling liquids alot it's a big hassle. But if it's just you, I find they are actually wonderful if you've got a lot of cooking to do and they vacuum up quite easily)  Edit:misspellings User 7: Add a rug or two. OP: Definitely. Any suggestions on the color of the rug??\n",
            "User 4 - rjhqmd Original Post: Very hyped about my new living room/studio room! Any idea on how to ramp up on cosiness? Image: a bedroom with a couch, table and various potted plants. User 1: I love all the green! I think this is a nice reading chair away from me moving in. OP: Ohhh so that’s what’s missing! Maybe terracotta tone? Thanks a lot and you’re very much welcome hope you like coffee User 1: I'll bring my French press, it'll be mental User 2: Personally for me I think it needs height on the wall in front of the sofa. I feel like my eye is sinking almost to the floor from these great, tall plants and mirrors on the right. It’s very pretty but I think the bareness is what’s making it a bit less cozy on that side with the blank-ish wall. The lamp is tall-ish but also very skinny and it’s not a place for your eye to rest so it’s not giving the area the oomph something more solid might. Maybe a big mirror or hang the picture higher? Overall very nice space. OP: That’s a very good point! I’ve been a bit struggling with the high dark ceiling and how to make it work. There’s already a high triptyque mirror against the wall next to the table on the right, so yes you’re right a couple frames higher up the wall would help tie the room with the ceiling and help make it more coherent! Thanks a lot for the sound advice User 2: Glad you found it helpful, again, it’s a very pretty space even if you left it as is and you should totally be proud OP: Thank you! User 3: I feel it needs a really huge piece of art on the left hand wall. Something spectacular! OP: Yesss love the idea of going bold I have already started the search! Thank you :) User 4: I would hang some type of warm tone curtains and place the rod close to the ceiling to draw your eye up. OP: Yes you’re right it would help a lot with the coziness! There’s actually already a rod up there where you mentioned, but I’ve no idea how to make it work with the fact that the wall is on an angle. Probably need to track down the previous renters and ask what kind of witchcraft they used User 5: Can that ceiling light be moved closer to the center of the living room and lowered? It is beautiful, but gets a bit lost up there in the beams. Stunning space! Nice layout  Edited for grammar OP: Thanks a lot! But no it cannot ._. User 6: I would rotate the rug so it goes under the couch and towards the little table. I think it looks a bit cramped and unbalanced with one side of the floor very ‘ruggy’ and the other side very blank. OP: Part of it is because of the wide angle I think, in real life it doesn’t look that unbalanced. But that’s aah interesting idea I haven’t try to play with rug placements to see what looks best. Already wishing the down stairs neighbors a nice time while I test that out haha User 7: This is perfect!! I wouldn’t do much else tbh...aside from maybe sheer or light colored curtains at the window OP: Thank you!! Haha I wish I could but like the wall is on an angle and I’ve no idea how to put up curtains on that kind of wall damn it would give a lot to stop waking up to blinding bright light on my face in the morning… or noon..2pm User 8: I've seen some curtains where they attach the rods on top like usual, and then they add discreet hooks at the bottom where the curtains can be hooked into! Could be a DIY project if you have time, you'd just need to stitch little cloth loops onto the edges of your curtains and drill in or stick small hooks onto the edge of your window sill. OP: Thank you for the tip, that should be doable! User 9: Command strips (heavy duty) or even the large hair clips onto a rod would definitely allow you to have curtains up. Darkness is super important for sleep I think 😉 OP: Haha I had accepted my fate of bright light but yes I’ll do something about it :) thank you! User 10: I feel like the big plant next to the couch could be moved, it would open up the space and make it more inviting. Right now it feels a little in the way - but that’s also just my opinion based of one photo! :) it’s a very nice room. You could also scoot the rug a little bit into the room, just so it leaves a few cm gap in front of the console table. Same idea: inviting and cozy! ♡ OP: Yes that plant needs to be moved slightly but there’s something nice about it being in the room because of the depth it gives with the two other palm trees. I couldn’t capture this feeling with photos unfortunately, on the photo here you’re correct that the plant seems a bit like clutter :) thank you!! User 11: Only one pic? Looks like a cool spot OP: Thanks! There’s been a lot of great tips here I’ll post a follow up on tips with more photos :) User 12: String lights along the beams? OP: That could be fun! User 13: So beautiful! I love this space. I would get another rug for under the bed/side table and some wall art. Otherwise, it’s already really cozy User 14: What a great vibe! What about a large piece of art opposite the couch? User 15: I think it would be cool to switch the living and sleeping areas! That way the bed isn’t in a corner, and your couch isn’t in the center of the room. User 16: Looks great but the middle of the room looks odd. I think its the couch and the plant side by side. Keep plants to the perimeter. Also if you moved that chair/couch to the left of the rug and then got a comfy sofa for where the chair currently is, I think that would bring warmth. The current chair doesn't look comfy and it's small compared to the rug so it makes the space seem cold. Just my opinion, other than that looks fantastic! OP: You have a good eye! I agree with your point on the sofa, the little sofa is a bit of a place holder until I can invest in a nice comfy one :) thank you! User 17: StoneFX feature wall . Stonecoat it User 18: Id add two floating shelves opposite the couch to add more plants and photos/art. Then for me its missing a throw blanket and some kind of lounge chair User 19: wondering if a nice standing screen between the bed and the living space would help to make the separation between both spaces look more deliberate?   it might block some of the light from the window but if you get a silk screened / translucent / lattice type screen it wouldn't User 20: There's some great suggestions here already! I think that you could tie together the ceiling with your eclectic design with some paint, if you're allowed to paint the walls. If you can, you could try to color match the dark bluish color of the ceiling and paint both the window frame and a big, floor-to-ceiling stripe 2-3 feet wide right where your painting on the left is, as a statement wall.  If not, you could add wall decorations and shelving that color instead. If you can find curtains of the same color, you could hang them from the curtain rod you have. An easy way to keep them close to the wall would be to install a coat hook, sideways, on either side and tie them there, if you like the gathered look.  For a cute and easy touch, painting your plants' pots a main color would be great! Dark blue to bring the ceiling color to the floor, and then gold rims would be my choice, given the gold accents you have. /u/leannesaidso has some fantastic points that would go well with these ideas. User 21: Personally I wouldn’t change too much — it looks almost perfect to me (but I am not a fan of clutter). The furniture feels like it has adequate room to move around without bumping into things.  Only thing I’d add is a cozy armchair to the left of the couch (facing the window) plus maybe a little basket with a blanket or two beside it. Add some candles and maybe a nice textured throw on the bed and I think you’re set!  What a beautiful studio, you are so lucky!! It seems really bright and airy with a nice vintage touch. Lovely. User 22: Perfection! OP: That’s so sweet, thank you! User 23: Yes, should've added a fireplace and some natural rock wall OP: Damn I would kill for a fireplace ._. please call the landlord User 23: Lol , have a good time in it\n",

            "User 9 - kavgv0 Original Post: Make my bedroom cuter/cozier. We are stuck with this ginormous furniture (I hate it) and rearranging is basically impossible with our King bed, windows, and two doors. What would YOU do?! Image: a bed and dressers in a large bedroom with a fan. User 1: If you’re truly stuck with this heavy furniture, paint the walls beige and go like Moroccan riad with it. (I’m assuming your bed matches these dressers and has a tall headboard that would block the window if moved against that wall? If so, don’t block the window.) A tall palm plant in a basket-type planter, crisp white duvet with salmon or sage green sheets. Lots of canvas throw pillows. Throw your curtains out and get some plant/leaf ones with a white background and rich green leaves OR get all white bedding and gold or mustard yellow curtains...or emerald green! Get a bed skirt to cover your storage and declutter everything on your dressers and try to get them like 5in further apart. Put a cascading plant like a pothos on the tall one and out a gold or bamboo/rattan tray with some candles on your short one. If you have matching bedside tables, declutter them too. Get 2 matching gold with white shades lamps.  Biggest changes are gonna be reasonable money-wise too: paint, curtains, plants, bed skirt  Edit: Yes!! All awesome additional suggestions in the comments under me if you have extra funds, like: rattan fan blades, changing out the drawer pulls. I would also hang your photos above the bed in a collage wall (someone mentioned you can see you don’t have a headboard in the mirror) and switch the frames up if you can find like old dark vintage wood frames and gold. I don’t see the need for a rug to be honest, but maybe a black circle one or oval? User 2: I would do this, and swap the drawer pulls and knobs for something that matched the Moroccan theme. User 3: Totally agree. OP - your furniture is BEAUTIFUL. Paint those walls, get some plants, declutter the top of the furniture and get lighter curtains. Quick doodle: [URL] User 4: No headboard on the bed. Check out the reflection in the mirror. User 5: Also can replace the fan blades with brown rattan woven blades like Casablanca. OP: Omg you are a genius. Can you just come and do all that for me? Thanks. ;)  There is actually no headboard! So yeah, I like the collage idea. THANK YOU. User 6: I guess I'm old fashioned but I looooove these gorgeous pieces. I'm sick of white cardboard ikea crap and miss the handmade sturdy look. I'm jealous!! User 7: This all sounds good. I would contribute—paint the walls and ceiling all one color. Replace the ceiling fan (unless you love it of course) with a flush Mount chandelier, replace the curtains with light colored ones that make it feel cozy, and a bedside floor lamp. Definitely change the drawer pulls on the furniture. User 8: Deiling fans are so useful! And, it would be easy to get one that goes with the theme. I know they aren't design-y, but they are wildly practical. User 6: You need a bed skirt. User 9: So you’re saying that you can’t split up the two bureaus? Because if you could, I would consider moving the large armoire to where the bed is now and moving the bed in front of the window.  Edit: and then centering the smaller bureau and mirror. OP: Yeah, basically the only way they fit in the room is close together like that. It's been a year and I'm dealing with it but I also hate it so much lol. I'm just looking for easy ways to cozy the place up... Somehow taking the focus off the giant furniture. I dunno. User 9: Ok, well in that case, I would de-clutter the two bureaus. Consider making some of the pictures wall hangings.   Also, get a cozy comforter that goes with your curtains. Or, if you’re not keen on the dark curtains, buy lighter colored ones and match the comforter with them. User 10: I actually don't mind the furniture! If it was me I would change the curtains to white, add an interesting rug under the bed that pulls together the warm and the cool tones of the room,  switch the bedding to a white duvet/comforter with accent pillows that match the rug, and move the pictures that you have on the furniture to the wall. From there I would add a few plants to go on the dresser and a cool lamp or two. User 11: I would store/lose the mirror over the dresser and then center it under the window that's on the right. Flip the bed so the head is where the dresser used to be and put the armoire facing the foot of the bed. I would replace the curtains with something lighter or put in white shutters or wooden blinds, and try to find some soft, fluffy bedding that's got warm tones and texture in it. User 12: I second removing the mirror! It's making the dresser look heavier than it is. Freeing up some wall space means OP could hang the pictures on the wall, too. OP: Genius. I never even considered getting rid of the mirror. It's a part of the dresser, but obviously we don't have it connected or even hanging on the wall yet. Thank you! User 13: Exactly what I was going to suggest! And paint the walls a more neutral color but add color to the soft furnishing... some big pillows, a nice duvet cover.... User 14: I would paint the walls. User 15: Personally, I'd paint the walls and trim a nice neutral color (like Behr- Spun wool?), and then sand down/repaint the furniture pieces a nice muted semi-neutral color, like an olive or grey-blue! I feel like it'd really brighten up the room & bring some new life to the older looking furniture pieces! :)   Other than that though, declutter a tad, some new curtains, and a picture or two on the wall maybe? User 16: Yes! Do this! Put the bed under the window. Scoot the dresser over so it’s centered on the wall and move the armoire over to where the bed is in the photo.    You could also paint the furniture to a lighter color so it doesn’t feel so overwhelming in the room. Swap the pulls and knobs for something less tardy looking and that should help brighten up the space. User 17: Why do you say you’re stuck with the furniture? You can’t sell it? User 18: I would get some nice bedding, try to de clutter the top of the furniture and maybe add some wall decorations. And of course plants! User 19: 1) rearrange furniture if possible to break up chunky stuff 2) get nice bedding, maybe a white duvet/cover 3) make sure you have table/desk lamps to turn on at night, makes things much cozier! 4) texture always helps - some velvet or faux fur pillows User 20: Definitely lighter curtains, a more refined neutral bedding User 21: As a former homeless person, I would learn to love the furniture. OP: Thank you, I'm forcing myself to love it by never getting rid of it. ;) User 22: Put a plant between the two big pieces of furniture. It will open the space.        Bed skirts. Maybe move the bed under the window? And a puff, [something like this]([URL] or a cute chair. User 23: If you turned the bureau 90 degrees, it would be just too wide for the space between the corner and the window, correct?  Other than moving furniture, I would focus on color and adding a lot of plush bedding. I wouldn’t rule out putting bold wallpaper on the wall with the dresser (if you can’t hide it, make it a feature) or the wall where your headboard is. (And if you don’t have a headboard, get one.)  The rug is a good neutral to build off of. Think about colors that go with the wood tones (ochre, navy, etc) and what style you like (modern, traditional, etc.).  Paint the other walls something cleaner and neutral. Some wallpaper ideas (sorry about the prices, find a style you like and then shop around for price and similar):  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  Simplify the curtains by using left-and-right hanging arrangement. If you need more privacy, look into wood slat blinds or layer sheets.  Bedding is going to give you the biggest bang for you buck, cost-wise. Layer up your bed with new duvets, a bed skirt, and a headboard.   If you do not use the ceiling fan, consider replacing it with a new fixture.   Drum / traditional: [URL] ; [URL] ; [URL]  Or, look for bladeless ceiling fans or ones with retractable blades that fold in when not in use.  Post updates!  — This is way too funky / modern but I just had to throw it in: [URL] User 24: Change paint color, get new curtains. Remove mirror from dresser, it just adds bulk. Try decluttering the top of dresser too User 25: I would take the mirror off the long dresser.  It'll give you more options of places to put it if you don't have to find a spot that fits the mirror. User 26: It looks like the mirror is not part of the furniture set.  So I'd either get rid of it or switch it for something gold/brass framed. User 27: Here's what I personally would do: Paint the walls white or cream; the blue clashes with the wood.  Replace curtains with floor length sheer white.  New comforter or duvet for the bed in a light color and add a bed skirt so you can't see what's underneath.  Clear off all the items on the furniture - if you have a lot of pictures, maybe do a gallery wall behind the bed?  Replace the dresser mirror with a modern round mirror and hang it on the wall.  Add a coordinating rug.  And a couple plants.  I know you hate the furniture but the wood looks top quality and I think if you used a natural color palette of cream/green or something like that it would blend in much better. User 28: The furniture is fine, I'd paint it white, but that's what I do with everything. My main opinion is, if you hate it, get rid of it. Why can't you sell it? User 29: Painting the walls white will help make it more cozy. Making the furniture a lighter color might soften the room a bit. You don't have to buy new furniture you can paint and stain the darker wooden to make it lighter User 4: How do you stain dark wood to make it lighter? User 30: I'd get rid of the mirror and put a big painting or print in.  I find Andrew Wyeth's \"Master Bedroom\" super soothing. User 31: I'd position the bed in the corner if possible. Then put the long dresser  on the wall where the bed is now. Or. take off the mirror and put the dresser under the window? User 32: Paint the walls olive green or ink black. Bring in brass accents and tropical house plants. Maybe a Persian rug. User 33: * do you have to keep all these pieces in the same room?  Could one become an armoire in the dining room or something? * are you opposed to painting any of the pieces?  Matte black/navy and new hardware could go a long way (especially on a relocated piece) * could you get rid of at least the mirror and hang a circular gold mirror in its place? * consider painting the walls a pale sage or a creamy white (like navaho white) * consider new curtains.  They are hung at a perfect height, but the brown overwhelms the room with the cherry furniture * declutter the top of the cherry furniture OP: Thank you for validating my curtain height. :) Husband was critical that they were too high! What color curtains would you do? We prefer sun-blocking ones because our bedroom faces east. User 34: An option is also to have a sun blocking roller curtain or similar mounted inside the window frame and then have curtains that don't need to be sun-blocking User 35: Can you sand / paint / change hardware ? If not I would go for a cosy hog warts library vibe User 36: Paint every thing in neutral colors. Make the bed with good linens like you would see in a hotel. That means bedskirt or wrap, throw pillows and something to emphasize the head .... A fabric headboard can be diy'd easily. Curtains or cushions could be used. If you can't sell and replace the furniture paint it white, gray or black so it is cohesive and blends with whatever you chose for walls. The less colors  you have over all, the less chaotic it will look. User 37: The blue van be changed into a nice warm color. Maybe beige or forest green User 38: Put a rug under the bed, paint the room a darkish green and get cream curtains. Get a nice bed frame. User 39: If the furniture isn't antique, I would paint it all white and then 'age' the paint a bit. User 2: I actually really like the blue walls, but I’m not sure I’m very good at paint colors. But you could sand and stain the furniture to something darker and less 90s, keep the walls blue, and swap the curtains for light, airy white. I would then trade the drawer pulls for another shape. I know you would probably have to keep the hardware on the cabinet with the key under the mirror, so I would try to keep that and just update the rest of the pulls with something that is still brass but looks newer.  I might even lean Victorian with a bold floral somewhere in the room. OP: Ah, thank you on your idea to keep the blue walls. I don't necessarily love the color, but I'd like to avoid painting if possible. Googling new drawer pulls now... ;) User 40: Google ways to modernize old furniture. There are ideas worth checking out others haven't mentioned here.  I agree with all other suggestions already mentioned. But I would prioritize the wall color and whether or not you wish to modernize the furniture.  I would put some furniture coasters under the legs of the big furniture. Seems like the carpet will be permanently impressed in the future.   Could out a rug under the big furniture.   If you get ride of the mirror, keep the mirror and find a different frame to repurpose it. This goes in hand with modernizing the mirror.\n",

User 1: Looks amazing as it is to be honest. Maybe make small additions, like mirrors or allow moss to grow. User 2: No don't paint this...don't touch it.  It's charming.  ETA: since this is a north facing wall, I would grow moss on it.  SOME moss, not a lot, but it takes a while to grow anyway.

User 5: How do you know it’s north facing User 6: Because OP said as much in their comment below :) User 7: I don’t have a colour suggestion, although I think it’s more calling for a mural.. but you can get window mirrors like the below which would open up the space.. [URL] OP: I like the idea of mirrors (I’m gonna get some to put on the bricked up windows in the wall to the left, you can’t really see them tucked in the ivy in this pic) but I feel like on that wall they would just reflect back at my house’s back wall... unless they were slightly pointed skyward maybe? Hmmm, thank you for the suggestion? User 7: Yeah, they are better with foliage over them as they look less obviously like mirrors then. By they way download the dulux visualiser app, this will allow you to virtually paint the wall, yellow might look quite good and bring a bit of sunshine to the wall, but it’s more about the look you are going for really OP: I’m in Ireland, and my garden is basically the ruins of the house that used to be behind/perpendicular mine - old stone walls on either side, with a large concrete wall that is part of my neighbour’s house. So it’s not technically a ‘room’ anymore, but it still has the fireplace and windows from when it was a living room. I need to clean up the ivy a little to stop damage to their wall and roof, so it’s a chance to get that wall power washed and painted.... but what colour?  This photo is facing south - so that wall is facing north, and so it’s in shade all day. I’m thinking a modern sort of grey or dark green would work well with the ancient stone walls on either side and highlight the plant life I want to put in there... any ideas? User 8: Check that it's legally yours to paint before you do anything.   It might be in your garden, but it may be fully owned by your neighbour. Where we used to live one of our house walls was the neighbours garden wall and (after some nonsense with them trying to trellis over one of our windows) we found that we had 100% ownership of the wall and they couldn't do anything to it without our explicit permission. User 9: Glidden Pale Jade. User 10: A dark charcoal grey would be perfect. It'll add more depth and make anything you place against it (like the green leaves or red door) pop even more. User 11: Don't you even dare!  It's perfect User 12: I like a white wash for that, but without harming the Ivy, would be tricky, better to leave or decorate with more wall hanging plants User 13: What about a yellow? User 14: I like the idea of a darker teal or a deep sea blue, then add natural wood elements and climbing plants/trellis.  Would climbing variegated climbing hydrangea work for your climate?  Please keep us updated on what you decide upon! User 15: White or maybe power wash it User 16: I really like it as it is! Agree about adding decor items and/or moss User 17: I wouldn't. It looks very cool as is. Maybe add some metal artwork to the wall. User 18: [Pressure wash it]([URL]  I've heard of people using wallpaper specifically designed for outdoors to put up murals but I've got no idea how much it would cost. Unless you are wanting to do some intricate stenciling I'd be talking to local artists.

User 6: Whatever you do, you're gonna wanna do something asymmetrical. I don't see the thermostat as that big of an issue, really.  I'd start with a lamp or something in the corner. And balance that with a larger print on the left. Then a couple of smaller prints on the right to connect the two. Then I'd space out your speakers (you're probably gonna want a wider soundstage, anyhow), move the stereo over to the left, & figure out some vinyl storage for center. And then rugs always help.

Autocorrect doesn't like the word clashing. I think I will do a red lip, thank you!! User 5: Lol I knew what you meant! :) User 6: I always go for gold accessories and it just makes me feel old Hollywood to pair red and gold together! I’d pair a short gold necklace, dangly earrings, a watch, and a couple of bangles together. For the hair, I always wear mine down but I think a bun would look cute! And the makeup, I’d do a neutral gold eyeshadow look with a lip that matches your dress. OP: I love that idea! Old Hollywood is such a great vibe. Thank you for your suggestion!   I actually cut my hair into a bob the other day so my hair options are limited. I regret not waiting until after the event to cut it. I'll probably just curl it.\n",
            "User 14 - hdvxje Original Post: Which of these jeans should I keep ?? Last two pics are the kind of look I want to go for (and have way too big hips/ waist for 🙃) Image: the four pictures show what to wear with old jeans. OP: I have quite literally never owned a pair of jeans in my life that I’m comfortable in / fit well and look good before, so I am endeavouring to fix that. Open to any advice from those that understand the ways of jeans 😂 User 1: Love A! I agree with you as I’m not a fan of paper bag either but with the belt you can’t tell! I’d recommend Rebellious Fashion for jeans similar to the style pics at the end. Also ASOS and Stradivarius ☺️ OP: Tysm I’ll have a look into them ! I definitely think I’m leaning towards A as my favourite pair, B just .. the whole tight at the top thing and then loose at the bottom doesn’t look right to me ? User 1: I like B too, they really flatter your legs! I always have to try new clothes on a couple times before deciding. Try styling with a few different tops and outfits - always gives a good indication of whether they’ll fit in your wardrobe and you’ll wear them.  If you’re still not sure if you love, send them back. If you don’t love trying them on, you won’t wear once the tags are off! You can always re order if you change your mind :) OP: Yeah I’m definitely going to have to have a bit of a play around with B to see if I can make them work. Trying them with a mix of different shirts is definitely a good shout ! OP: I do love the jeans in the last two pics but I have chonky hips and thighs so I doubt they’d ever look like that on me User 1: And noooo! It’s all about finding a brand that works for you! Jeans are so different from everywhere you buy and it’s definitely worth ordering from a couple different places to find a pair that suit you and you feel comfortable in. OP: I may or may not have just ordered £100 worth of jeans off ASOS to have a play around with 😅 the joy of free returns User 1: Enjoy! I love new clothes orders 🤩 User 2: I really like B! Where are they from? OP: They’re from TKMaxx (uk version of TJmaxx from what I can tell) but are originally river island brand (: I do like them I’m just a bit uncertain about how they look around the crotch area, kind of.. bagging up in lines ? I don’t know the technical term lol. But I’m not sure if it’d a good look or not User 2: Ah I love river island jeans! I see what you're saying but I thought they had the best fit esp around your hips. Personally, I prefer jeans to be a little more fitted around the shins too which is why I liked B. Which ones do you feel most comfortable in though? OP: These were my first pair of non-primark jeans hehe. I’m more comfortable in A (not a massive fan of the Paperbag waist look but I think I could get used to it) but might end up keeping A and B because they were only £10 each. User 1: 2, 5 and 6 User 3: you should try the asos design balloon leg jeans! ive never found a pair of jeans that fit before these so now i have 5 pairs lol. theyre nice high quality stiff denim with a relaxed leg fit but tapered towards the ankle, really high waisted and actually have enough room in the hips/bum/thighs that i can buy my true waist size and they fit perfect! for reference im 29” waist, 38” hips and large bum and thighs, and i still have room to spare in the hips/bum/thighs! OP: Ooooh could you drop a link ? They sound perfect 👀 User 3: sure here you go! they also have them in other colours, lengths and body types (regular/petite/curve/tall) - [URL]    just so you know, i fluctuate between a waist of 28”-30” depending on the day/bloating etc and i bought the 28” waist jeans because i when got the 30” ones at christmas they relaxed with wear and have become too big! the waist 28” ones were a bit too tight at first but have now relaxed to fit perfectly, hopefully thatll help you with sizing! they are a stiff 100% cotton denim so they have no stretch but relax and become looser and softer with wear and washing :) if you happen to be a waist 30-32” ill happily sell you my old ones cheap 😁 OP: I am a 30-32 !! Are you in the uk ? User 3: yes i am! i have a depop account i can upload pictures/info to and link you to it?? OP: That’s be awesome !! User 3: great ill message you with my @ when i have uploaded it 😁 OP: Thank you !! Honestly not 100% sure I’ll be able to buy them depending on the price (I’m on a student budget rn, and the reassurance of being able to return them if they don’t fit is the only reason I’m out buying jeans rn in the first place) but I’ll definitely have a look !! User 3: yeah i get you, im happy to sell them cheaper if you want them because i have literally no use for them and no one to give them to lol User 4: A, with the actual belt And B!! User 5: top middle User 6: where are jeans C from? i think they're really cute, i might want a pair like that.... OP: They were from TKMaxx !! (The US version is TJMaxx) I’ll send you more details on the cut and brand etc etc later (: OP: Sorry for taking so long to get back to you, the jeans are from River Island, the name is “Alexa, Crop Wide” ((:\n",

OP: I have Santa Cecilia granite, Agreeable Gray walls, bone colored beveled subway backsplash.  Sick of the cabinet color. Considering changing to a warm grey like the Sherwin Williams Intellectual Gray. Appreciate your inputs on whether this is a decent choice and/or any ideas to make this kitchen look more modern.  Here’s the other side: [URL] User 1: do you have pics of the sink units ? OP: Here you go - [[URL] User 2: Am I alone in thinking these are nice cabinets? Maybe slightly out of fashion at the moment, but fine? User 3: I think the cabinets are great.  I would update everything else to a lighter palate and avoid brown. User 4: Black with brass handles.   Beige with chrome handles OP: Thank you. I did think about it but we both don’t like to darken the space any more. So decided to  not do black. User 5: Check out Benjamin Moore Hale Navy. It would go well with everything you already have! OP: Thank you. I like this. User 6: I wouldn't paint the cabinets. I would paint the walls instead. I would also change the pulls. OP: Thanks. What style pulls are you thinking? User 6: Brass country style maybe. User 6: Or a more decorative chrome that could potentially pull attention away from the dark cabinets. User 7: I like the color :) keep the cabinets, change the counters, regrout the black splash with a light gray OP: Thank you. We haven’t fully decided yet to do the cabinets. Might end up just keeping them as is. User 8: This is the answer! The counter top is busy, and clashes with both the cabinets and back splash. User 9: Totally agree.  Don't ruin the cabinets be painting them.  It is not an improvement. User 10: Exactly! It is a loverly rich colour. I would only change the countertops with white marble top and install brass hardware. And a bright light runner :) OP: Benjamin Moore Swiss Coffee User 11: Cadet Blue (grayish blue) User 12: With all the other browns in that kitchen, and with stainless appliances, you can't go grey or black. It will just look like you painted because you hated the wood tones, instead of painting to make it look better.  Your floors and counter control your choices here.  Your grey wall color is causing some confusion right now too. Change that.   A pale buttery yellow will work or sage green will work for cabinets. OP: Thank you. It may not look like it but the granite and floor does have gray patterns. When we bought the house the walls were a dark beige which we hated. We changed those to Agreeable Gray as soon as we could. It has a slight warmth to it. Building on that gray I was hoping the Intellectual Gray cabinets would work because that color also is warm and I can see that color in the granite and floor. User 12: But the gray pattern in your floors and counters is not what you see when you walk into the room.   Just because gray is a decorating trend doesn't mean it has to be done. You have other choices. Your cabinet faces are not particularly \"modern\" so painting them will not make them that way. It will only make them more pleasant to look at. OP: Thank you. Makes sense. I am only trying to make it look a bit more pleasing/modern while minimizing cost. I am not a fan of the floors, granite and cabinet shape. But changing any of those is significantly more expensive than refinishing/painting the cabinets and hence considering the latter. User 12: I understand.   I am sometimes slow to make decisions about design because I'm so obsessive about getting it right. I argue with myself about spending money when sometimes there is really nothing else you can do but bite the bullet. I don't like to throw good money or time and energy after bad either.  But if I can get the look I want, it doesn't have to be someone else's definition of perfect.  Either way, I always approach the project with sensibility. I don't get hung up on brands or trends.  I set out to get my look sensibly.    One of the largest expenses in a kitchen redo is relocation of plumbing, gas lines, and electric. You can save a lot of money if you like the kitchen layout and leave appliances and sinks where they are   People these days are ripping out perfectly good solid wood cabinets from the 90's. When I say perfectly good, I mean solid boxes that aren't pulling away from the walls, aren't split along hinges or the grain, aren't water damaged, and don't have sagging shelves.  In these cases, I think it's better to reface than paint. But that's me. An alternative would be professional painting where the current finish is stripped down to the wood. Another alternative is to have a cabinet maker strip your cabinet boxes down to the bare wood and build new doors.  Changing counters is just expensive and there is no way around this. Tile floors can be tiled over and that may be cheaper than you think.   You said you want modern. There's really no way to get modern design with the counters and floors that you have. That doesn't mean they are ugly or hopeless. There is a way to get a lighter and more pleasing room.  It's just how much do you want to spend now, and are you going to feel bad later (when you actually redo the entire kitchen) about this interim cash you are spending.   The cheapest way to live with your kitchen right now is embrace the brown. I stand by repainting the walls.  Gray has no place in this room.  Perhaps the walls should be a buttery yellow. If the cabinets are in good condition, have a professional repaint them. Use a bluish green pale sage color. Paint the island in a slightly darker shade of yellow than the walls. Or, reverse this color combinations with pale green walls, darker green island and yellow paint on the cabinets.  Your alternative is a gut and redo. OP: Thank you very much for the detailed response. Much appreciated. I am still on the fence about this project. Did not know the tile floors could be tiled over. Will definitely explore that option - I believe that will be money well spent if I choose to go with a more modern style as it will uplift the entire space (not just the kitchen) and pave the way more cabinet paint options down the lane. Thanks again! User 12: [URL] User 3: I have also seen people use specialty paint and add stencils that really update the space.  Perhaps a while paint stencil to neutralize the brown?  Then lean into Scandinavian neutrals with the rest of your kitchen? User 13: A modern grey/blue might go with the fridge without compromising the warmth in the other colours of the space OP: Whenever a question like this comes along, it's always a good idea to ask yourself if you would be adding to the value of the house, or taking away from it.  These are nice cherry cabinets that people pay a premium for.  The \"painted\" cabinets that you see in the stores are not cherry...they're cheap wood...  If you're wanting a change, you might consider the granite... OP: Thank you User 14: To much time on your hands? Those are nice cabinets and don't need to change User 15: Dusty blue User 16: Paint them. They look like they are in great shape, so why tear out perfectly solid cabinet doors? You can change up the door pulls after. I had solid oak cabinets that were in great shape . I didn’t like the stain colour , so I had them professionally painted white. Love them now:) OP: That's exactly what I am planning to do. Just need help to decide the right color. Here's the other side of the kitchen - [[URL] User 17: Slate grey or blue User 3: I would leave the cabinets, but change the floor and countertop.  You can likely sell the existing countertops to help with some of the cost.  I would put in new whiter/lighter ones.  Then do the floor later as you have the budget.  Think about swapping the cabinet pulls for something more modern - black, brass, etc.  If you would consider plants, I would place some in coordinating pots at the top of the upper cabinets. OP: Thank you. I didn’t consider flooring yet as I was under the assumption it requires removal of existing tiles, which is cost prohibitive and messy. Just learned today that I can tile over tile. Definitely going to explore that option User 18: You can’t tile over tile, but you can put a floating vinyl floor over tile. Search for luxury vinyl tile (or plank, if you want wood in there instead).   Source: I sell flooring. OP: Thank you so much. I am only looking for wood-looking vinyl flooring, not real wood. Do you think that could be installed over these tiles? If so, how do they manage the space under the doors? User 18: Depending on what you do, it really only adds about 1/4”. Usually your floors have enough of a gap. What kind of flooring do you have adjacent to the kitchen? Would you consider running the flooring throughout the whole level? User 18: I’ve read through all the comments and don’t agree with a lot of them. I feel like you can definitely go grey in here. I sell flooring and I’m trained to see the undertones in different materials and I definitely see grey in your countertops and flooring. Especially with the stainless steel, I think grey would be fine. Comments suggesting yellow or sage seem really out of sorts and will likely date the kitchen more than it is now and not work with the rest of the house.   I don’t mind your wall color. It’s very neutral and warm still. Countertops would be a good change, but that’s also very expensive. Dark cabinets are out of style right now and I don’t think they are coming back any time soon, so painting them wouldn’t be the worst idea.   I think the color you picked out would be nice. I’d maybe suggest doing it only on your bottom cabinets and do a lighter color on your uppers. Or a different island color (like a forest green?) to add some more interest to the room. I think just adding some color to the room would be a major help, regardless.   I also don’t hate your cabinet pulls. They are still modern.   Another alternative would be to only paint the island cabinets. Would be cheaper and add a needed update way easier. Eventually you can change the countertops to something else, and if you’re tired of the paint color then, paint it something else!   Good luck! OP: Thank you so much. Needed to hear this. As you rightly said, there definitely is a gray in the floor and countertops, but the pictures are probably not showing it well. This is the specific reason why I picked a warm gray (SW Intellectual Gray) for the cabinets. I am not sure whether to use that color or maybe go a step lighter.   I am also going to look at the vinyl over tile option for flooring. User 18: Sherwin Williams has a great visualizer where you can paint specific parts of your own pictures using their tools. I’d mess around with it. Try just painting the uppers, all, just the island, a different combination, etc.   The kicker with using these tools is that your current colors aren’t going to look in the computer how they look in person. I’d retrace the walls using the tools and put in Agreeable Grey, then do the walls and doors in a white. This well help give you a more true image of what the colors you choose for the cabinets would look like in person. User 19: I think a dark blue or black would really look good in there. Maybe with copper handles for the dark blue and chrome or brass handles for the black. OP: Thank you. We did think about it but decided to go a bit lighter. Hence the gray color. User 20: Navy blue!  Alternatively, switch to white stone countertops. User 21: I wouldn't paint the cabinets any color except \"black\" or \"white\". Almost everything else is forcing it and will be out of style in a few years anyway. Your countertops and floor are less up to date than your cabinets and while PITA to change,  you will get more usability by concentrating there. If you make changes now to \"match\" an already out of date flooring, later on you will have to change both. User 22: Thst sounds really good. The current colour is definitely not great User 23: Here you go - [URL]\n",

Mine have pretty much worked out of the box User 2: Mine always worked but configuring with Dolby Atmos really made them sound great User 3: The left monitor is too close to the wall,  I would shift both to the open side of the desk.  But that may not work with the rest of the room.   You could rotate the smaller monitor 180 too OP: I don't think the perspective gives the location of the monitor a right idea of how it is, but as it isn't VESA I'll need to get an adapter for a monitor arm. I haven't learned if I can rotate it. It's not my monitor, landlord just told me to use it.  I've considered moving the monitor to the other side of my console monitor though.   I like the office space in theory, but it's not to my liking. I'm not able to cut into it or modify it structurally.

Good luck. OP: I can't put the monitor above, cabinet it right out of the shot. I don't\"work\" from home, do optimal convenience is priority or productivity. I do mostly console gaming and streaming on the right, and discord, general life stuff on the left monitor.   I did find that I was able to get a VESA adapter and I can rotate orientation.

Image: an empty room with an empty wall and floor. User 1: Reading nook! Reading nook! Reading nook!  Pop a couple bookcases and a cushy chair + footstool + floor lamp + some art and you're gold. User 2: Some big bookcases would help this space a lot. I think it's too bright and clinical but a couple big bookcases, softer lighting, and some furniture in a dark jewel tone would help the space feel like a moody little mini library full of shoes. Which honestly sounds like my dream room. OP: Are you thinking book cases on the right that surround a seat or two with ottomans? User 1: Yeah I'm thinking one bookcase per wall and then a little central seating area! But whatever works! OP: This area is about 20ft by 15ft rectangle with entrances to the other rooms at two of the corners as seen. The picture is from the top of the stairs. Unfortunately, we need to consider a shoe rack with a bunch of shoes somewhere as well and this area seems the most spacious for it. There are about 50 shoes in boxes.   We were thinking of how to transform this area to a reading room like feel with a couch and foot rest and lamp or something along those lines. Maybe some sort of art on the long walls. Our budget would be no more than $1200. Thanks for your suggestions! User 3: 50 boxes of shoes is a lot. Do you already have the shoe rack, or will that need to come out of the budget? User 4: I’m chuckling at 50 *pairs* of shoes being *a lot*. OP: Haha I’m sure some people have way more but it seems like a lot when trying to figure out it’s home in this space. OP: We have a simple metal shoe rack right now. If we reuse it then it wouldn’t come out of the budget. User 5: Ok, due to the size of the space and your style of choice I would keep things simple and minimalistic. I would recommend painting that wall we see on the left a bold, interesting color as an accent wall. And a couch on the right. A light brown leather is what I am picturing, with a lattern/textured ottoman. As far as lighting, maybe consider mounted lighting on either side of the sofa? This again frees up some space and will make the room feel larger, elegant, and cozy.  Wall art for sure!    Are the shoes meant for storage or display? That effects things.  I love this project! If you are interested in pictures of what I am saying specifically, feel free to message. Otherwise no worries.   Good luck 😊 OP: I’d say half of the shoes could be part of a display but some are older and probably better suited to stay in their boxes.   I’d love to take a look at some pictures if you are able to easily put it together. I really appreciate the insight! User 6: You can mount some closed shoe storage on the walls. Something like Ikea Trones [[URL] or similarly thin to maximise your space. Then put a nice chair like this [[URL] a lamp and a plant. I'm just using Ikea because I don't know any American shops.  But if it's for reading, are you going to have books? OP: I really like that chair! I’m grateful you shared the link to IKEA since I didn’t even know they had that. The closed shoe storage is interesting and I’ll have to think about it some more.   We don’t have many books and most of our reading are on e-readers. We could probably display some items on the shelves if we don’t have enough books.   Thanks again for the feedback! User 7: Seems like you have plenty of room to build an actual closet with shelves for the shoes (and whatever else you want). Some drywall, 2x4s, trim, and paint would set you back less than $100 and add some resale value (who *doesn't* want more storage). You'll still have plenty room for a desk or reading nook.  Not sure if I would put the closet on the wall straight ahead or the one to the left. Depends on which would work better for the traffic flow of the space. User 8: Maybe some softer lighting, would you consider painting the walls? Floating shelves, nice round rug and some bookshelves? Maybe put some plants around too! [Like these]([URL] OP: I love the plants idea. We have some already and never really thought about putting it in this space before. We have mostly been trying to put them near windows so far but it could be a possibility if we start to use some imagination. Thanks!!

User 1: This is pretty minimal as of right now. It can go in a lot of directions, what look/style are you going for? OP: Hi! as I put in my comment, we're trying to go for a modern alpine chalet style. I know that's not really a thing... We're drawing some inspiration from this book: [URL] but there are a lot of ways that this can go. The overall home is built in a classic bavarian chalet style by a guy from Germany. We'd like to keep the character of that, but not the folksy-ness of it - we'd prefer to modern it up, use more clean lines. User 2: I didn’t know this style was a thing and I LOVE it!! Thank you for introducing me to it ☺️ User 1: You can definitely keep the rocker chair, maybe dress it up with a plaid blanket or pillow.   Are you planning on a TV or is that a TV on the left-hand side of the picture? If it is, I would place it center on that wall with a nice fireplace entertainment center beneath it. If it isn't, a nice picture frame tv would be nicely mounted as if it were a fireplace and have it display a fire when not in viewing use.   A bench with pillows that you see in a lot of the photos can be placed on the barrier \"wall.\" Opposing it (wall with windows) can be a cozy couch that fits in the aesthetics you already have going. The center of the floor can either have one of the fur rugs you see in a lot of the photos or a generally plain rug. On top of the rug, you can have a chest (functions as a coffee table) or a minimalist coffee table.   I wouldn't really hang any decorations, there's already a lot of nice views/woodwork going on and you don't want to distract from that beautiful charm. OP: Hi there,  The rocker won't stay in this room when it becomes the dining room unless there is a real reason to keep it here. We can move it downstairs to the living room or to one of the bedrooms.   There is already a sitting room/living room/den downstairs with all the traditional stuff - couches, chairs, TV, fireplace. User 1: WHOOSH on reading dining room for me XD OP: Ha! No worries! I'd be happy to hear your dining room suggestions :) User 1: From the pictures you've provided, the second picture works for the area. Bench on the sides with the windows/open wall to keep the area open feeling.  I would opt for another neutral/plain rug under the table since chairs can really scuff the flooring. Make sure the rug extends far enough out for the chairs to slide in and out on top of the rug. If you're not a fan of the benches, the third picture also works since the chairs all have low backs. Basic takeaway, keep the view as open as possible. User 3: No pointers lol - but what an awesome space!!! 😍😍😍😍  ETA - Ok I have a pointer - WHITE (faux) fur rugs, lots of cozy blankets and pillows and fluffy, fuzzy otomans/chair. Oh and fairy lights make everything so warm and glowy. OP: Hello! We've done that type of decor in my daughter's bedroom in this house - lots of faux fur pillows and rug, soft cool colors, cozy blankets and pillows, fuzzy ottoman - you nailed it!  No fairy lights... I should definitely do that for her. In this dining room though? Not as certain about the stuff that will be hard to clean food out of! User 3: Ahhh! I'm so sorry, I didn't read and realize it was  to be a dining room!!! Lol I was picturing a family room. My bad! Ironically though I worked on a set tonight where they had faux fur table runners across their dining room table and was so beautiful. If too much while eating, just take off. But we're not eating at dining table much of our day. They also had (I swear, not associated, I had to look at bottom of candle to see where from) these awesome flameless candles that looked SO real (from a fee or two away), from Luminara. BUT dining table over a big faux fur rug, with the faux fur runner? OP: Well, you DEFINITELY nailed the look we used in my daughter's room, and that we will probably riff on in the family room, so kudos - you know what we're after!  I love the idea of the faux fur table runners. We actually have a breakfast bar in the kitchen (for now... until we redo the kitchen at least) so I foresee this room as being the \"everything else room\". Homework/school work. Games. dining table, huge dining table for someday when we can host again... so the faux fur table runners actually would work pretty well most of the time!   Great tip on the candles - I have a feeling these will \"warm\" up many of our spaces! User 4: If you don't mind what's your profession? How did you get into it? User 3: Hi! This was random help for my husband's friend who is a TV producer. He asked if I could come help him with setting some stuff up (basically, make it pretty) because they know I have experience with event planning and love that shit. In general though, I'm a \"C-Level Executive Assistant\" which over the years, and with working at several different types of companies, has made me wear many different \"hats,\" one being the event planning stuff. Basically, as an EA, you have to be willing and ready to do it all, big or small. The setting up events (whether it's a corporate conference or a weekend retreat) was always my favorite part though. :) User 5: Start with the floors - which look like it could use a cleaning. Or better yet a sanding. If that’s not possible, clean, wax, then get some nice rugs, one for the main area and another smaller one at the top of the stairs to cover all the scuff marks.  Medium wood dining table that fills the room, with leaves so you can expand it for large gatherings- not recommended for now, what with COVID. Cover or upholster the dining chairs in a nice color like green.  Then some nice white sheer curtains that drop to the bottom of the windows not the floor as it looks like you have heating registers. OP: Thanks! The floors have been cleaned - they definitely need to be sanded and refinished - they have water damage and scuffing from years of neglect (we just bought it). Unfortunately, we'll have to wait on that project since the wood floor stretches all through the house and will need to be done all at once. We won't get to this right away.  The dining table I'm having built will actually be a modular table, so rather than leaves we'd have two smaller tables that can be added to the main one either banquet style (long) or conversational style (square). I linked a design in my top comment.   What would be considered \"medium wood\"?  We are looking for suggestions on dining chairs that will be comfortable for long sits. Will keep your recommendation of covers/upholstery in mind. User 6: CAn you show where you are building your table please OP: Here is a sketch of where I think the 3-part modular table could be set up and the various configurations we would use. [URL]  Note that the fan is centred in the section of the room bounded by the stairs to the lower level, so I imagine that's where I would put a nice light fixutre (whether it's a fan or not)  The full room is 21' by 21', with a 10.5' by 8' space with the stairs and weird loft where my husband wants to put a fly tying setup. User 3: Hi! Me again! Haha. How long were you thinking of waiting to have your floors refinished? Asking bc my husband and I moved into our new home in June (from tiny NYC apt.) and tried to hold off on buying the bigger furniture items, really settling in, getting all the cute decor etc. until we had the floors redone bc removing and storing all that stuff elsewhere to have the floors done for a week or so...ughhh! OP: I have no idea when we'll get the floors done. There are a million things that need to be done in this house (it's a second home, major fixer upper) so despite how bad the floors look, they are functional and may stay like this until summer, or even longer... it's not a job I can do myself, and contractors are hard to find here... I have a million contractor jobs that I have to chip away at. There is a good chance that we won't do the floors until we're ready to do the kitchen since taking out the cabinets will make floor work a ton easier. User 7: This isn’t really about layout but I am wondering if it would be cool to have some hanging plants that grow downward to create kind of a a cascading living wall over on that open wall by the stairs (those are stairs right?). As a cool way to create a little more separation. Also I have a similar situation with my floors and yes I stare at them all the time hoping they magically get better but I know when I’ve saved up enough for the project they’re going to look amazing. In the meantime, rugs and call it rustic. OP: The floors are an eyesore, I know. Everyone says oh, but it's hardwood, you don't want to take that out (and they're probably right) but man, it's not the hardwood that I would have picked! I do intend to do a full refinishing eventually, but that is another set of hard decisions: What do I do about the one room that has carpet instead of hardwood? Do I pull the matching hardwood from the bottom floor sitting room and refloor down there as well? If so, then that's now TWO whole floors that I need to be worrying about all at once. Sigh. Buying a fixer upper like this, sometimes it's hard to know where to start, and how to \"scaffold\" the job. We intend to continue to improve over time, but ... I need a plan! User 8: This looks like an amazing space! Are you very tied to having a ceiling fan? If not, swapping that out with another light fixture could be a simple way to bring more of the modern feel you're looking for. Maybe something like [this]([URL] or whatever fits your style ! OP: Ooh - that's a pretty light fixture. I fear that it would be way too small for this room, though (11\" diameter light in a 22' x 14' room?). I need something that is going to take up space and shed a lot of light (otherwise I need to worry about secondary light sources like track lighting, which I'm not necessarily opposed to, but hadn't been considering so far). Also, there is no air conditioning in the house (we only get about a week or two per year when it is sweltering!), but the huge windows and glass patio doors (not shown here) also let in A LOT of sun/heat in the mid-day, even in winter. If I can find a great fan that fits the decor and also circulates the air, that would be really great. User 8: That's fair, I didn't check the dimensions but agree something bigger or multiple of them would be needed to fill the room with light. With or without it though, extra light sources are always a good way to add more dimension based on your style + adjust lighting for the vibe of a gathering! User 9: Your floors look like oak.  Fortunately, it's still available like this.  I've patched and matched in 2 different houses.  It works well, so don't worry about them looking somehow different when it does get done.  Sanded and finished you'll never know.  I'm assuming you want a multi purpose dining area.  I suggest a round/oval table with a leaf.  If you get four or six side chairs, your 2 end chairs can be more substantial and used elsewhere...a buffet is needed too..it can store linens/games/dishes...  I don't think I would put drapes in here... OP: Yup, they are definitely oak. But the extent of repairs needed to the floor (which stretches through the house) will require us to wait on the refinishing job. Maybe this summer!  Yes, if you look at the comment I made earlier we are hoping for this to be a multipurpose room, though there is a sitting room/living room/den downstairs with couches and fireplace, and where we will put the TV. I would like this room to be a place where multiple things can be happening at once. Maybe a conversation at one end of the table, a card game at another... maybe there is a puzzle or a boardgame in progress. If you look at my original comment you will see what I am going for table-wise - 3 tables which can be placed together to accommodate larger parties (someday!) or which can be moved to other parts of the room to accommodate varying needs. This room is very large, so a table that would only have six side chairs (three on each side) would look way too small. I'm thinking at this point that the main table will be 8' x 4'. with two 4' x 2' tables that can be placed at the ends or to the side (you'll have to check out the link I posted if that's not clear). I do need to figure out what to do for chairs. User 10: A big farm table [somethin like this]([URL]) Maybe take a look at a lodge type room OP: Hi! Yes, if you look at one of my other comments I posted two links to the inspiration for the table we're having built. I considered benches like in the link you shared, but I'm worried about that being really inconvenient and not super comfortable for long periods. I want this to be a place that people gather around the table and mingle and visit... so looking for chairs that are inviting and comfy! User 11: Agree with the other comments to start with refinishing the floors. Either restain or leave natural color. Neither choice would be wrong. You mentioned you already have a table picked out so next is to focus on accent furniture. I see two different floorplan directions you could take. First option, you could place two matching buffet cabinets under each window and leave the far wall for decorative accents (options could be hanging a large metal sculpture, \"installing\" faux/real fireplace, hanging several large paintings, or doing a combination with several open shelves). The second option would be to do a large furniture piece on the far wall somewhat off-centered so that you can also put a small bar cart there for after dinner drinks. Then, under each window, put matching narrow tables and decorate with various candles and fresh flowers. Both options give you extra storage for dishes and any seasonal table decorations. With either option, I'd also put drapes on the windows. Either a dark color if you go with light chairs or light sheers if you choose dark seating. Agree that chairs need to have arms and be comfortable because this is a space you want people to want to stay in. I'd have the head chairs in different fabric and different colors than the others. Whatever color the head chairs are, that's the same fabric color choice for the windows. For lighting, I'd hang two fairly large, matching light fixtures to help offset a long room and make the room feel more connected and cozy.Once you get these big pieces, accessorize with plants, candles, pillows and an area rug. OP: This is really great and practical input! Thank you!  Unfortunately, for a number of reasons (see other comments) the floors won't be refinished soon. Summer would be the earliest. But in the meantime, I need this room to start to come together and I need to make furniture choices!  I love the idea of the metal sculpture... There is already a large stone fireplace in the lower level living room space, so less inclined to put one up here.   We have lots of extra storage available elsewhere in the house, so those buffets you mention would probably end up housing puzzles and games. Haha.  Thanks for the chair suggestions - I love the idea of tying in the head chairs to the window treatments. Do you have any suggestions for chair style? It's so hard for me to know what's going to be comfortable when I can't go sit in anything! (we don't really have access to much in terms of furniture stores near here...) User 12: Use woods that match the ceiling I think:) OP: I'm pretty sure that's pine on the ceiling and I definitely don't want a softwood table. Plus, I'm worried about it looking weird on the orange-yellow oak flooring - not matchy-matchy but also not contrasting enough, you know? User 12: Oh lol I'm just thinking from your picture that keeping up the contrast and colour scheme in the room would look nice 🤔🤔 doesn't have to be the same wood but a similar darker kind of stain??? Or a totally different idea!! OP: Ah - are you referring to the beams? I'm definitely more on board with trying to match somewhat to the color of the beams! We were kind of thinking that already... our carpenter is asking us to choose a wood (maybe walnut?) and then we can stain it darker... User 9: a dining table would help......gather people......for dinner? User 13: I like it just the way it is..\n",

User 1: 👍 for the rug and the pendant light both.   Nicely done! User 2: I love everything! I would angle the chair such that you could put a lil end table in between them though... Also kinda wish the rug bigger, but not sure by how much lol... User 3: It's a really nice looking rug.  Have you found the flaw? ;-) OP: What do you mean by the flaw? The rug is hand made so it's not going to be completely straight in every corner and such! User 4: True Persian rugs will always contain one deliberately incorporated flaw. Reason being is that only god can make something perfect, never man. User 3: Exactly. By incorporating a deliberate (often nearly imperceptible) flaw, the weaver demonstrates humility to his fellow man and God. User 5: There should be two gold fans in the center of the border at the short ends. I would never have seen it if not for that comment. OP: Can you mark that up on the picture for me? can't see what you mean :) User 6: The rug shouldn't be touching the baseboard - I'd pull it out about 6+ inches, and maybe make it equidistant between tv stand and couch, just so it feels centered. OP: Done! If I understood correctly you wanted me to have rug more centered between the tv stand and couch? In the pic I posted I can see it's almost underneath the couch. It looks much better centered. Thanks a lot for the tip! User 6: Correct! Glad you like the change! And yeah, the other part of that was not having it touch the wall, so just scooting it out a few inches. User 1: It really ties the room together, dude. User 1: It really ties the room together\n",

Pull the rug further out from the couch. OP: Makes sense, thank you!! Glad I consulted this sub. I was thinking rectangle but was worried about walking into and scratching myself, a roundish shape makes a lot of sense User 4: Something round would work best for the L. User 5: Reasons? Idk anything but my first instinct would be a rectangle table. User 4: Easier to move around in tight space, feels more organic and cozy. User 6: How does shape of a table make it feel more organic? User 4: It just makes the space feel softer. How is this that hard to understand? User 6: Because that differs a lot from the definition of organic. User 7: Something like this would work well in this layout:    [URL]  It provides that organic layout mentioned. The term organic is commonly used in design to reference the nods to nature and natural materials. It includes but is not limited to materials, shapes, etc. When they said shapes they are referring to the fact that most organic things have a perfect balance of beauty and imperfections. A square table would not have due to it's rigid structured design. The L shape of the sofa and chaise would also work well in this setting so shins and knees don't accidentally slam the corners of a rectangular table.  Hope this helps, great set up so far! OP: Thanks!!! Very helpful User 4: Wasn’t talking about the literal definition. Not sure why you’re so stuck on this. Move along. OP: Thank you for the help.

User 1: If you can't find one, maybe go with wood. The contrast will be less stark. OP: Interesting. I hadn’t thought of this. I suppose a wood that kind of matches the cabinet?  User 1: Exactly. It will give a little bit of continuity in the different hues that are already in the bathroom. OP: Wait so would this be better looking than the mauve toilet seat completely?  User 2: Generally yes, since you’re matching to another fixture instead of matching to the overall hue of the room, which results in a very saturated visual effect  OP: Thanks so much for your input  OP: Do you think that the pink matching seat is ideal and the wood seat is second best looking? I’ve found a good match for the seat color I think but now I’m not sure what would look better  User 3: I think a matching seat would look best, but if it's not a perfect color match (and chances seen slim that it will be, but you never know) then it's going to look odd and you'd be better off with the contrast of wood.  OP: I totally agree that if the color isn’t a perfect match it will drive me crazy. I found the exact model of toilet and a company that claims to make toilet seats that match the exact color of that model but they are non returnable if it’s not a true match. Perhaps I’m safer getting a wood one.  User 4: I lived in a rental with avocado bathroom fixtures (to be fair, it was a...light avocado so came off more like a sage green and it wasn't that hideous.)  The landlord had replaced the seat with a black plastic (??) one and we went ahead and swapped it out for wood. It looked fine. But the benefit of either of these was the warmth.  OP: The wood is warmer or colder?  User 4: Warmer than a porcelain one. This was in the UK and the bathroom was chilly in the morning! User 5: How about gold? OP: In my search for the mauve toilet seat I discovered you can get toilet seats with flecks of gold inside  User 5: Yeah, I meant more like sold gold. Might look decent with the color scheme. Or at least look consciously ironic.  User 1: I agree with that. I think a match would be best but wood is a great second option. User 6: In my vast experience with weird coloured toilet seats, the colour tends to fade quite quickly. You may buy a dark pink seat but in 6 months or so you will be left with a light pink toilet seat.  User 7: This is what I was going to say as well. User 6: I’m not sure, but if you absolutely can’t find one, I would recommend.... gutting the whole bathroom and matching it to the white toilet seat.. haha OP: Lol. A totally reasonable suggestion if it wasn’t a rental!  User 8: What about taking the seat outside and spray painting it? User 9: I googled “vintage colored toilet seats” and got the following potential results:  [URL]  [URL]  I’m into vintage bathrooms and there are a lot of blogs out there on the topic with links on relevant vintage/salvage and reproduction fixtures.  Good luck! OP: Thanks very much! I think I actually found a really close match on plumbingsupply.com!  User 10: The 70’s? User 11: I think it was actually the 80s. My parents built their house in 85 and we have a mauve bathroom. And my mom SWEARS it was the style back then.  User 12: All of the fixtures in my restroom growing up were this color and our house was built in 1994.  User 13: Bemis is sold at almost every plumbing supply shop. They make a variety of color-match seats for vintage fixtures. Color samples are available on their website and at your local suppliers. They come in standard and elongated, depending on your bowl style, and all of them are soft close. User 14: Oh dear Gawd. You have my sympathy. If you cant find the right shade maybe you can go full on tacky and get one of those clear ones with fish in it?  User 15: Build.com has one in raspberry or loganberry that look like might be the same color but it’s almost $60 so.... 🤷‍♀️ OP: Thanks! I actually just came upon the same colors on plumbingsupply.com and I think raspberry looks like it’s a really close match. I appreciate you looking  User 16: You can try one of those transparent ones.  User 17: You might have to order a few but a quick search on Amazon results in several shades of purple or pink.  OP: None of the ones I have found online have looked close to this color. It’s a very unique color it seems.

User 7: Lol it should be in the rules: before making a post asking for advice, make sure you have covered the basics of plants, artwork, and a rug. User 8: If my room looked this amazing I think I’d have a better attitude about life User 9: Love it all. Great armoire.   Totally agree with popping artwork above bed. Personally, I will go with a painting, original and 1 big one as opposed to several smaller ones. Something personal…. Personally, I won’t do a plant. You have it already with your view.   Also agree with 2-3 things on the shelf above bed. Something that makes the room yours. Perhaps something with meaning/ memory etc. What you have one the armoire will also look great on that shelf. Might show great against the wall color.   I like your taste. User 10: Lighting in the soffit, could be pots that shine down or a strip the shines up off the ceiling. OP: Thank you! I really like your idea of adding lights on the soffit! I will try this! User 11: Cool unisex vibe, imho. Feels kind of upscale hotel, where anyone could come in and sleep there happily.

User 16: You COULD invite me over. User 17: Wow this is a great space. Honestly you don't need to change much- you've done a great job with colour coordination and choice. Way more mature than many of the other places I've seen here that just look a bit too much like Patrick Bateman's apartment.  I agree with the others that some personal items would be nice though- perhaps some small family/friends photos above each nightstand? User 18: Bed skirt and maybe a plant or two User 19: I’d change the bed frame for a more masculine looking one, something more square and made of wood, and some artwork above it. Other than that it’s perfect! User 20: Yeah the bed frame has to go in my opinion. User 21: Looks great!  Art work above bed, maybe a mirror, plants.  I think it lacks a focal point, which is why this beautiful room feels a bit incomplete.    Do you have room for an old chair?  Every room is better with one! User 22: Can you do my room next? How would this improve your space? Well....we won't find out till we try, right?   More seriously, fantastic job! You have a keen eye. Some wall art would be a nice touch User 23: It already looks nice, albeit a tad bit feminine, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but it could use a jolt of masculinity. 3 things I would personally consider changing — 1. Fringe rug 2. Bedding 3. Bed frame  Those are just my 2 cents. It does look nice as is though 🤙🏼 OP: Thank you for your suggestions! User 24: I agree. Looks great. I like the bed frame, but if you are going for more masculine look you could get a picture frame, a mirror, or a piece of art that’s got an iron look to it that compliments the design of the headboard. If that’s your cup of tea then a few accent pieces can change vibe of the bed frame. User 25: Do something with the curtains/curtain rod. It looks a little exposed, like wires trailing behind a tv. You can get a cover for it or upgrade the rod itself to something a little more decorative.   I agree with the others about a little artwork and some plants. Room looks great, but I think these would make that much better. User 26: that is a killer guest room and wouldn't change a thing. It's very inviting, very clean, perfect for family members and friends to come stay and feel comfortable.   If this is your bedroom I still stand by the adjectives used but depending on your age and martial status could use some age appropriate personalization.   If married your wife has free range so maybe make your bedside table have something cool on it like a solar powered or steam powered miniature engine. (google them they always look cool and have many different designes) incase it in glass gives it a classier touch. They look amazing and you can use them to teach your kids how engine's work some day.   My father has alot of these and casually showcased throughout the hour where you wouldn't notice unless you were looking and then think \"damn that's cool\" and he taught me about engines using them because they really do work in was pretty fun. There is also a very large enthusiast group for the hobby so if you want to expand its there and people get really into it my dad made a full functioning miniature workshop with old school punch drills and everything factories had to use back in the day off the one engine. (he doesn't showcase that in the open but was fun when people are really interested to bring out. The hobby as a casual one or deeper it's just cool my book. It shows you know how things work can assemble and run them and these machines were so beautiful in the day. Casual Manly as F if you ask me.  If its just your place I would also add a wooden chair next to the dresser to pull back to it casually have an wood axe sit on it propt up and some leather work boots on the floor next to them with a flammel drapped across the back of the chair. but I guess that one would totally depend on the area you live. if you would never use the axe and don't even have a fire place then dont i believe manly decoratiom should be functional to a degree.

User 32: In my opinion, a different bed frame. User 33: Plants User 34: Poster of Bo Derek right above the bed on the ceiling should do it. User 35: Honestly think you’ve succeeded. Some photos art on the bare walls ought to do it. I live like a psychopath. There’s nothing in my apartment so I’m digging this. It’s nice and bright. User 36: I like it as is, I like tidy minimalist but cosy looking spaces, would just add some pictures and plants as others have said. User 37: Looks so nice. Maybe some carefully picked out items for the walls? User 7: It looks like a bed and breakfast.  Charming, but no personal flare.  In addition to the plants and art everyone suggests, try adding some colour to the bed spread as well. User 38: Attractive lady on the bed. User 39: Stand in it User 40: Curtain rod is too high, curtains are top short. Tie them both back with rope or something to frame the window and give dramatic effect User 41: Add art above the bed and a plant.   Replace the fringe rug (unless you love it!) Replace the ceiling fan (regardless of how much you love it.) User 42: This bed needs a bed skirt! I love your space, you’ve done a fantastic job so far. User 43: Hot tub?\n",

User 7: Bamboo in the windows or center also they have black bamboo could be a nice contrast OP: Look up Nixie tube clocks that’s what I’m eventually putting there User 8: I really would want to take like a router or something to put a dip into your alcove and put some lights in it.  *Maybe* then put an accent color along the inside walls of it too.  Not quite sure what I'd put in it for display tho.  Also not liking how close your chair's color is to your floor.\n",

It has the elements I’m looking for, lace vneck, top full skirt, cinched waist... thoughts? $250 Image: this women's dress has a full skirt and beading. User 1: If you like it, that’s all that matters. Do YOU think it’s pretty? Do you like the materials? The only thing I will say is, don’t let the price sway you. If it was 700 dollars, would you still like it? And I’m not saying that you should look outside your price range at all, but just know that you can find other inexpensive dresses if this isn’t totally what you want. There’s been so many times that I see something cheap (I have a very low budget) and I go “oh yeah I like that” but when I really think about it, it’s not what I want and it’s just the price that starts to sway me.  User 2: I think it’s gorgeous and classic. My only worry would be that the skirt may wrinkle a la Princess Di.  User 3: I think it’s pretty. I think lace sleeves always look a bit matronly or something when sitting on a mannequin like this. They look sooo much better on an actual human though.  User 4: This style always looks strange on a mannequin - Maggie sottero had one in 2017 called brentleigh that is very similar that I wore - I loved it!  It is a classic style - simple, elegant and beautiful.   Bring a steamer to the wedding though!  Edit: reading through old posts - I missed that autocorrupt had turned sottero into softerotica lol User 5: Hello! Only ask if it doesn’t have stains or tearing fabric.  Ask if it was made some alterations on it. After that  I think if you like it but it.  Is not expensive and you can ask for alterations for fitting your body.  Congratulations!  My best.  User 6: I think it’s very elegant.  User 7: I think it's very pretty! OP: Thanks for all the advice! I didn’t get it, check my post history to see what I just bought today!

User 1: Post a picture with the ceiling or with more sense of the room in general User 2: * [This one is kind of awesome]([URL] but may take a little DIY. * [Also love this look]([URL]  But the key on all of these is going to be scale, which is hard to tell from your photo, and how low it should hang so you do not bump into it. (Many are adjustable but some may have narrower ranged of adjustability.)  Figure out what size the light should be first, then shop on that width. It will narrow your options considerably. The right style is no good if it is not the right size.  Good luck!  P.S. Love the void-kitty! User 3: Love the top one. If you want something bigger, a lot of Etsy sellers do custom. User 2: YES, excellent point. Have gotten many custom-sized things off of Etsy. User 4: That second one is stunning, saved for future reference !

Rustic?  Edit: Lostwallet’s first suggestion is perfect. My advice is go with that one  Edit again: Lostwallet’s second suggestion is even better because the metal brings new and complementary texture to the room.  You folks have much better taste than I do! Every suggestion is great! OP: Thank you so much! I was looking for a statement piece that is not too large given that the space is not exactly big. I'm not very good with labels, but some of the Youtube designers I follow describe the style that I like as modern/midcentury/organic whatever. User 11: I love that rug!  Where did you get it from?

[here is the link]([URL] might be cute for this if youre into this. OP: Yess I was definitely thinking gold accessories and red lip! Low bun would be cute too. I have some black heels with a gold toe strap that could work perfectly buut NYC winter so we’ll see.   Jacket is so cute! User 2: These are great suggestions. Especially that coat!! I would go with the gold accessories.. Perhaps adding some color like mustard yellow, burgundy, or maybe even brown for the pants?? You can’t go wrong with black though. 😊 OP: Burgundy pants could be fire User 1: agreed!! you dont see a lot of burgundy and that colour actually works well with this deeper green. you should post an outfit update if you can! would love to see how it turns out. User 3: I thought of red too but maybe too Christmassy ? Unless it’s a Christmas party in which case it would be ✨ User 1: agreed!! User 3: High wasted black wide leg pants maybe? With some gold or silver detailing, and wear a necklace with the same hue. Definitely accessories to elevate.  I like the blazer idea in the other comment as well. OP: Absolutely!

Can I ask where you bought it? OP: Absolutely! It’s from Rihanna’s savage x fenty line but currently sold out. I bought it second hand from someone on Mercari! User 6: Something RED. Really vibrant. User 7: I would wear this with tan wide leg pants, white or black chunky heels or boots (with the foot covered) and a tan blazer. You could add gold jewelry User 8: Ohh. That’s preciousss. If I had the body for it I’d go for wide leg/ palazzo high waisted pants and boots underneath, the slim looking kind. Nothing ruched. Both gold and or silver accesories will work fine. Even black for a more goth look. But that depends on the vibe you want. Pants could be white or ivory would look amaaazing. If You could show me options I’d gladly help you style it 💛\n",

Would love to see suggestions.    Thanks and Happy New Year! User 3: I would get a more boxy looking sectional in a rich jewel tone color or a light neutral. The couch is currently the same color as the wood which makes it too heavy looking.   The area rug should have a more modern look. IKEA has great rugs for a great price point. User 4: Pearl User 5: white roof, yellow walls. User 6: A nice wam cream. User 7: Benjamin Moore Decorators white. it's a perfect white with no blue or yellow tint.

Thanks :3 Image: a man's jacket with buttons in a gray checked suit. User 1: I'd wear a cream silky blouse, black dress pants, and black pumps (patent if you have them). OP: Thanks! Would  flare trousers work (only a little flare)? And what about a turtleneck? How mich jewlery should I wear? User 1: I think both of those would probably be fine, although it depends on your proportions.  I'd keep jewelry simple and neutral, gold hoops and a chain necklace.  White would also work, to me cream looks a bit more sophisticated. But it also depends on how \"white\" the white is in the blazer which is hard to see in a small pic. OP: Okky thanks! I'm definitively petite x3 Alright I'll look for something with the same white tone :3 User 2: It's winter so i'd recommend a black boot instead. And a ribbed black crewneck top. OP: What about boots like these? [URL]     (hope you can see it)        I own boots that look very similar. User 2: Hmm maybe a bit too chunky and casual, i'd do something like this: [URL]  I also like how the geometry of the block heel and pointed toe work with the checks of the blazer.    [Steve madden point toe ankle booties]([URL] OP: Okay thank you! OP: Yeah right boots seem much smarter. I do have boots but I have to try them on with the rest. OP: Oh and why rather cream than white? Sorry I'm a noob at fashion ^^' User 3: I personally don't like the idea of cream. But that's the thing it's all subjective, there's no right or wrong... Mostly. OP: Yeah I think I'm just gonna go with the same white as the blazer is to make sure it matches :3 User 4: All black would look stylish and polished in my opinion. You can do flats, boots or oxfords instead of heels. Flats will give a kind of “academia” vibe, which is nice. OP: Yeah I think I'm gonna go with black for the rest of the outfit :) User 5: You can even wear a cream long sleeve shirt if a cream blouse it too much. Usually the color cream looks very luxurious in comparison to just white. And it’s a color that looks good on all skin tones. It would look more put together than all black unless you have a pretty black blouse. OP: Okky thank you! I dont know if a blouse would be too much because the blazer already looks special but I'll try one on tomorrow when I'm shopping \\^\\^ and I'll definitly look out for a cream long sleeve. User 5: You can even pair it with a grey long sleeve and black pants. You may like that too, if you end up not picking a blouse. That way it’s not too much of a reach going all out with fashion, and you’ll still feel comfortable. OP: It is for an apprenticeship as a clerk (i have no idea if it is translated correctly, sorry)  in a real estate agency. User 6: I always like a hint of red with houndstooth if not for an interview!  Good luck!!🍀 OP: Thank you! User 7: It seems to me that dark blue is often associated with looking professional. User 8: I think a black turtleneck would look sharp. I second the cream-coloured blouse suggestion too OP: I like the black turtleneck idea too, especially because I alredy own one \\^\\^' User 8: And bonus: extra cozy! OP: Yes exactly! And it matches with the weather xb User 2: The blazer is a statement piece, so i'd tone down the rest with: Neutral tone slim fit top (heavier knit, cashmere-ish, mid or long sleeve), black straight leg pants, black ankle boot, and probably a small statement necklace.   Ultimately you want something you can move around & feel comfortable in. OP: Thank you. I've got some black dress pants already so I'll probably wear them. And Ive also got some black boots. Only have to find a good top and some nice new jewelry :3 OP: What about boots like these? [[URL] (hope you can see it)  I own boots that look very similar. User 9: I don’t think those particular style boots would be appropriate. I would say a heeled boot/bootie. OP: Okky I'll look into that thanks! User 9: I think a cream, white, black or even a rich dark red top would be fine (being professional does not mean only black and or white colors).   Black pants  Pumps or boots with some heels. OP: Okky. I don't know if I'm comfortable enough to wear colour. But I'll take the blazer shopping tomorrow and we'll see ;) Thank you! User 9: I think a silky creamy blouse would be very beautiful with a subtle gold necked and earrings.  Avoid bracelets as people jiggle them or move them around when nervous in interviews and it’s distracting. OP: Alright thank you! I'll definitely look out for that :) OP: And I guess I have to leave my rings at home xb User 9: If you are a ring fiddler , yes leave them be. User 10: Cream or soft warm coloured blouse, black skirt and tights, black shoes. User 11: Jewel tone blouse, slim black pants, shoes to match blouse.

User 1: Hmmm, you will probably find this too simple but my first thought was a simple paper light - one of those lamp shades made from white paper. The room looks so nice and calm, I wouldn't want the lamp to be distracting. OP: I’ve posted on here before, but still stuck. I tried to get help from the Havenly design consult but still not sure. One suggestion was [this]([URL]  light from World Market for more texture, but also thinking of [this]([URL] light. It comes in brass but also black...   Any ideas? My ceiling is only 9’ high so not a ton of room for a big chandelier or anything like that. And I’m trying for something more than a simple drum light   EDIT: Wow thank you all so much for the suggestions. Definitely some great ideas. I have another bedroom to do and will definitely refer back for ideas.... I ended up going with my option #2. Can’t wait for it to arrive! User 2: I do like those, but if your room gets warm at all in the summer, you'll appreciate a ceiling fan immensely.  They're also useful in the winter for pushing the warm air back down where you can feel it. User 3: I second the ceiling fan. I can’t live without one. User 4: I have a ceiling fan with a large filament bulb instead of a shade on the light and I couldn’t live without it. User 5: I LOVE the beaded chandelier! I have been eyeing it myself. User 6: I actually like it as well! It almost looks like one of those firm cushions/ottomans, with the braided cable... I have no clue what they would be called, but do you know what I mean?! User 5: Yes! Love those. Tufted ottoman. User 7: I quite like that second light you linked. User 8: I like the second one you linked a little better, but both of those would work. I would check out Shades of Light. They are pricey but have some cool stuff:  [URL]  Edit: I just tried to pick a random example but this one is a little ugly lol 😂 User 9: Of all the options suggested, I like the two you've already chosen!  And good on you for being willing to take a risk, design-wise, with your lighting! That beaded semi-flush mount light is pretty cool. My only concern is that it could limit your design choices in the future. If you want to change up the look of the room anytime later on, you'll likely need to change out that fixture again, whereas the second option is more \"classic\" and will go with more looks. User 10: I know this isn’t helpful for your specific request, but don’t be afraid of design..  Why a flush mount?!?? Doesn’t world market make that beaded version in a gorgeous, like amazingly draped chandelier?!?!?  I mean, you could put a bright coral number in there. You’ve got gray and white. User 7: If you want something that would remain fairly unobtrusive but still be unique, I think something like [this]([URL] would be wonderful. User 11: I like these for your room.[ 1.]([URL]  [2.]([URL] User 12: Ooohhh OP go with the capiz light linked above (#2) it’s so soft and glam and lovely User 6: Yes! #2 User 13: Cant See #2 due to not being in the US. Do you have another link? User 11: It's a capiz shell, flush mount light. I'm sure it will come up with a search. If you are in the uk here is a[ link to one similar.]([URL] User 13: Oh, Nice! Thanks a lot! :) User 14: I'd do a small crystal chandelier. User 6: Great idea! A touch of sparkle. User 15: West Elm has a ton of geometric flush mounts like this  [[URL]  that I think would look good in this room User 16: I’d put a ceiling fan that resembles bamboo leaves. Edit: One more thing to suggest.  Consider another curtain to even out both sides of the window. OP: Thanks! Ordering another curtain... wasn’t expecting only 1 to come! User 17: I think [this lamp]([URL]) would be absolutely stunning. And I think the space could handle it because the design is already leaning slightly masculine, so I don’t think the femininity of this lamp would be overpowering.   If that’s a little too ostentatious, I think [this lamp]([URL] would also be beautiful.  Edit: [This one ]([URL] is also great. User 18: That is a very nice Ikea light. User 18: I came here to suggest a large barrel light, so I'm no help at all. User 19: I do the same thing with a power strip next to my bed. Respek!

Either way, look through Serena & Lily’s other lighting options too. I have one of their capiz pendants in my dining room & it’s beautiful.

I'm thinking anything in a silver tone is going to work. User 26: Hi would you mind linking me to where you got the rug from?  It would be perfect for my room lol OP: It’s a Safavieh wool dip dye I originally got from wayfair but I found it [here]([URL] User 27: Go with something flush in a bronze or black tone  [Check out the photos posted in reviews for this particular fixture]([URL]  The light coming out will put patterns on the ceiling...which will give it light texture  I know its tempting to put in a light that hangs down, but to be honest, I never liked that look over a bed.    Its also worth noting you have a visible burn in on the ceiling (circle of less faded paint)  The fixture I suggested is 15\" wide...and that may be enough to cover that spot  If you go with a chandelier style fixture, you will only get a small junction box cover...and that burn in will always be visible  As for finishes...Bronze and black are timeless.  Where as nickel tones and chromes come in and out of fashion.  If you are spending good money on a light fixture, go with something that will work with all kinds of decor options so you don't end up having to replace it again in a few years should you change up the style of the room OP: Thanks for your detailed reply! The circle on the ceiling is from the people before me painting around the flush mount that was there... planning to repaint! User 7: I’ve had that same “fixture”!  Your room looks great, and has traditional elements, maybe something that is a lovely contrast to that vibe? User 28: [URL] User 29: Do LED strips around the walls at the top.

I wear light cotton or other natural fabric pants (denim does not breathe and gets heavy if wet, a cotton tee with a long sleeve shirt or cardigan in case the flight is cold, maybe a scarf to ward off chill from air vents, and socks and closed toes shoes,or athletic shoes. Open toed shoes or sandals are not good if there is an emergency situation with broken glass,plastic or fire. You can still look good when traveling,but please dress for safety too. Have a great flight!

The rest of that outfit sounds good though. OP: I don’t really have a body suit anyway so I was gonna wait for other suggestions but I got a crop top and over sized tee options\n",

I just got it from Nordstrom Rack a few weeks ago, so you may still be able to get it.  The brand is Betsey Johnson User 2: It's got such a retro vibe, maybe a mary jane or other vintage looking shoe in the red of the strawberries.    Do glamour hair   [URL]  Jewelry is up to you but I'd keep it simple and the focus on the dress.

            "User 38 - j7z6wp Original Post: Brother is renting loft apartment above garage...he wants flat white everywhere, painter (dad) says the walls should get a light grey to give some contrast. Thoughts? Image: a picture of the inside of an apartment that was recently renovated. User 1: Paint aside, can I just say how dreamy this apartment is?? Love the stairs. User 2: I love this place too!! Perfect for one person or even a couple. My cat would love the railings and stairs. I'm a little jealous lol. User 3: I think the color white is fine. I’m concerned that he’s painting a rental in a flat finish. That’s gonna be so hard to clean User 4: This. Use matte, flat will be a disaster just leaning up against it with a button on a jacket or even the little metal snaps on jeans. Scratches and marks everywhere. User 5: Omg they painted either flat white or just primer on our walls and its the absolute worst. I might have to invest in a 5 gallon bucket of matte washable type paint. I have a kid and a husband who both like to touch walls and leave fingerprints! User 6: I would steer clear of flat. User 7: Hard to clean but also super easy to roll-over again for touch-ups. User 8: Yup, this. I wouldn't want white, but that's what the brother wants so whatever. The real issue I see is with the flat. It's not washable at all. Definitely gloss it up a notch or two. User 9: It will have to be painted after every tenant. I do not understand why people put flat white on walls. Ceilings—absolutely. Walls—why? User 10: I personally like the white, having the ceilings and walls the same colour means that the sloping bits are not emphasised. Any way, I would always let the person who lives there have the choice... and he wants white! User 11: If the guy living there wants it white then there's no reason to spend time & money making it not white. It doesn't make any sense. He can always paint it later if he changes his mind. User 12: You are still allowed to change your mind after considering other peoples ideas/opinions...sometimes people (myself included) think they know what they want because they simply don't have an eye for the bigger picture until someone points out a great idea. Also i do agree with the father, that place could use a little bit contrast with that amount of space on the walls. If he truly doesn't want to consider another option he should be allowed to stick to his own vision, but i don't understand why you gotta make this about \"trying to talk someone out of their choice\" (especially with your second comment here). User 11: Because it's pretty common for people to be so focused on what they feel is technically correct that they don't notice a conflict brewing because the other person is having their point of view being stepped on when it's actually the more important one. Relationships are more important than paint. OP asked for advice and that's my advice. User 12: OP asked for thoughts on white or white with grey contrasts. He didn't ask for family therapy. User 13: Well my opinion on white vs grey is that the person living there wants white therefore it should be white  And in any case the room has plenty of wood to offset the clinical look white can give without contrast User 11: Too bad, once you post on reddit you are blood oath bound to take whatever advice you get even if it's just perhaps consider respecting your brothers opinions! OP: We do have to paint the walls another coat either way, and we already have the grey paint from a project in the main house.  You’re point is well taken but my dads argument is that the only time difference will be cutting in, as we have to roll it either way User 11: Still I would be pretty upset if my dad and brother made a decision like this knowingly going against my wishes, or tried to talk me out of my choice to the extent that they thought Reddit's opinion mattered more than my own about my own home (and it is his home as long as he's staying there) User 14: You may need to do more than one coat btw. User 15: If he wants white he should paint it white. There are so many shades of white to pick from. He can get a cool one which will lean slightly more gray and look that way under certain lights or go with a warm white (my preference) which will not feel sterile, especially with the wood tones. User 16: I think with the sloped walls, white is best for this space. Flat white on the walls and glossy white on the trim. Plus that’s what he wants? It’s clean and modern, go for it. User 17: Pick Sherwin Williams City Loft. It's off white, but sooo pretty and cozy. Not sterile looking, but still very white. Depending on the lighting and time of day it gets slightly pink, beige, grey tones. I seriously love it. I did my whole house in it! (Also, I am tired of the everything-must-be-grey trend). User 11: This space has a lot of angles.  Painting the ceiling white and walls a color will create too much visual busyness.  It's the opposite of what you want to do.  It's best to paint the ceiling ***a*** white and the walls a couple whites down on the color strip...your eye won't see it as two different colors but more shadows and light. User 18: I'd go with white but not flat. Those seem like high traffic areas, so maybe a satin or eggshell for ease of cleaning.   Light gray is blah/off-trend. Pick a different color, paint some accent walls? But as long as you're also going to put up photos, art, house plants, white is the perfect backdrop. User 19: Depends on his style. It’s his place. If he wants white then make it white.  As someone who like a more modern style, while I appreciate what Grey would look like. I’d go for white myself. User 20: I would prefer white, I think grey is on its way out.  If your dad owns the apartment though then dad wins. :) User 21: A few questions:  1. Is painting a rental really an option?  2. Is it currently not flat white?   Like the other comment says, there's no point making it not white if that's what your brother wants. However, your dad is right, a nice light grey would look better. User 22: I'm personally leaning towards gray, I agree with another commenter that white would be very sterile, and if this is a rental that won't be for family in the future, it'll help hide scuffs or scratches better than white walls would imo.   If he likes art, I also think the gray will help the art on the walls stand out a bit more, depending on how they're matted/framed. My mind is making that curvy staircase wall a gallery wall and I'm drooling over it lol User 23: It should be up to the person that is living there. User 14: White looks right right to me - it makes the structure the focus, rather than a wall color. There’s already the floor, the staircase, the eaves got contrast.   Light grey is starting to feel very dated, in my opinion, and may make that space feel a little dirty since it doesn’t have the ‘clean’ feel of 90 degree angles.  And skip the accent wall - that’s for big box rooms, not this beautiful space.   Oh and flat is fine for rentals - yes it holds dirt/smudges easier, but there is also no finish to show up when you touch up just spots. I have 2 rentals with flat and it’s fine. User 7: Gray has been done to death. White is timeless and fresh. User 24: It depends on what the decor will be User 25: I love white walls.  You can always accent w/ hangings.  But, have him look into how wall color affects perception of size, and visit something like /r/malelivingspace (or somewhere he can get decorating ideas) just so he has some idea of possibilities.  Agree w/ others on the flat white though -- it doesn't clean well.  Perhaps you could do some basic photo editing to visualize the gray (or other colors). User 26: Paint it white, specifically PPG Soft White. Just enough warmth to not feel stark and too bright. Sincerely, Leanne Ford. User 27: Flat white! I know painters hate it but you can always touch it up easily. Also when you are staring at a blank space it's easy to want some contrast. But the room doesn't end with the paint. Where the contrast should come in is with the furnishings, rugs and art. Think about an art gallery, tones of contrast because the walls take a backseat to the pieces that matter! You have to imagine all aspects of a room before they physically come together. User 28: I have a similar space, and advise going with the grey.   I had originally painted everything an off-white, creamy ‘bamboo’ color. The arrangement of light and shadows made some of the features nearer the ceiling (a bulkhead, etc.), look stark, washed-out, and at times reflected so much light there was actually unpleasant glare.   I repainted the upper reaches two additional times, with increasingly darker tints. Surprisingly, what worked best could be described as ‘buckskin,’ significantly darker than the lower wall.   Despite the sharp contrast in color, the difference is only slightly conspicuous at mid-day. In bright daylight, though, the color difference is not at all noticeable. At anytime, no one would notice the difference but me, but using a darker color up above makes the space considerable more comfortable and cohesive. User 11: I think the white looks great, if you have the grey paint then I would use it very selectively to help break up the spaces - the wall by the kitchen and the one by what looks like a bar. User 29: I think you can get a Scrubable paint now in a FLAT that will be a bit more manageable. Sherwin Williams makes it I believe.   I personally love white walls with dark trim if you're going to stain anything. Also, having just painted my bathroom back to white, if you're bad at painting, you can hide how bad you are User 30: Flat white is a bad idea. The color white is ok, it's the flat that will give you trouble in its maintenance. User 31: Go with the light gray. That much white would make the place too sterile. User 32: Light grey is always a better option than flat white. User 33: Off white walls are better if you want a bit of contrast for white skirting/doors. I’d go for grey. User 34: I'd agree with the Dad (personally) as it grey will definitely open up the space and help with a \"clean\" look esp in the kitchen where some gloss or semi-gloss will avoid things looking dirty. Beautiful space. User 35: Making the staircase walls a darker color and rest white Wud work well. But I Wud make it darker than grey User 11: Grey definitely User 36: My lounge has three ash white and one very light grey wall and I must say it looks fantastic! It’s we have a slighter darker grey sofa in front of the light grey wall and the subtle difference makes a major different aesthetically.\n",
            "User 39 - bhw39r Original Post: Help me pick out curtains, please! What color would work best? i was thinking a white/purple ombré. Image: a living room with a lot of furniture and windows. User 1: I have no ideas, but I just wanna say that I absolutely LOVE everything about this! Especially the couch! OP: thank you so much! the couch is my favorite too! it’s from Floyd Detroit :) User 2: I think if you stick with white curtains or white with very light touches of color like embroidery you will be good. You have a lot of color already and white would allow the focus to stay on those items. If you did the ombré make sure it is subtle. OP: good point! thank you User 3: I just wanted to say that I love your design aestetic. Such bold colors but it doesn't  look like a crayon box. Cozy and sophisticated and gorgeous. OP: thank you so much! User 4: Do you want fabric curtains?   Idk why, but I would go with wood blinds! The ones with bigger pieces. I just think would go well with your aesthetic. OP: i do want fabric curtains. wood blinds would be nice! but sadly, changing the blinds is against the rules here :/ User 5: Depending on what you plan to do above the sofa, I think white curtains would be really nice.  But if you want colour, instead of ombré, have you considered doubling ups on the panels so you have a coloured panel on the very end and a white panel in the centre? OP: i didn’t think of doubling up, but that sounds lovely, thank you User 6: I love the colours you’ve got going on in this room and the textures are so nice! I’d say maybe consider a patterned curtain as most of your pieces are solid colours and it might add a little variety for the eyes. OP: thank you! yes i think a subtle pattern would be nice to break it up a little :) OP:  [some details ]([URL] User 7: I would pick art for above the couch before you choose curtains. User 8: I think you have good instincts. You could also do a blue/purple or yellow/purple ombre. I personally would do yellow and purple, but that's just because they're my favorite colors lol. OP: thank you, & ahh yes! i didn’t think of those combinations, i think they would work well! gotta do some research. User 8: Best of luck! I love what you've done so far btw. These colors all work really well together so it's nice and colorful without looking messy. Yellow is a very complimentary color, especially when paired with darker colors like these, so that couch is perfect, in my opinion. OP: thank you so much! the couch is my favorite spot in the house. at first i was afraid of the boldness of all the colors together, but i went ahead and did it and i’m happy with my decision. it really boosts my mood when i walk in the door. User 9: I would move the curtain brackets higher and farther apart to make the room look bigger. The white ombre is probably a good idea. Anything too bold and solid takes away from your furni. User 10: I'd go for a lighter grey. Or if you want ombre, a white to grey ombre. I would keep the curtains simple so it doesn't pull attention away from the lovely furniture, which imo should be the focus of the room. I would avoid patterns on the curtains for that reason, too.   Alternately, if you want the curtains to be more of a focal point, I'd go with dark blue so that it ties into the rest of the room rather than competing with it. User 11: At first I was surprised at your color choices, but after looking at all your photos, I'm really liking it.  Since everything is a solid color, and even the pillows are subtle prints, you might consider a pattern for your curtains.  I think an Ikat print would go well with your style. I chose this one because, although the pattern is bold, the intensity of the colors are soft.   [[URL] OP: thank you, i like this pattern a lot! User 12: I looooooove your mix of furniture! For curtains I'd go with a bold, organic pattern that incorporates the colour of your sofa OP: thank you! User 13: Your space is lovely! OP: thank you! User 14: Do you have a picture of the room facing the window? So we can get an idea of the larger scope. As I see it now I would go with a light curtain but with a small pattern in a color either purple or yellow. I got these at bed bath and beyond and they’re my favorite thing in my house right now    [URL]  Something like this would be nice too. In your colors, of course   [URL] OP: these are nice! thank you. [here]([URL] are some different angles of the room User 15: How do you like the floyd sofa? I want it but it’s so pricey 👀 OP: i absolutely love it. i live in Detroit so i was able to go to the store and sit on it after i did a lot of research on it, and i fell in love. it is a bit pricey but the quality is great! it’s a very sturdy piece of furniture, it’s super cozy. & i plan on keeping it indefinitely so i think it’s worth the price! plus it’s american made 👌🏽 User 16: Is that COUCH from Weston’s? OP: the couch is from Floyd Detroit User 17: wow, this is incredible, and I think white-purple ombre would look fantastic. follow your instincts! and please share progress pics :) OP: thank you! will do! :) User 18: Honestly, more often than not, ombré fabric can look really dated and juvenile.   If I were decorating this space, I’d go with a traditional print, like a floral, done in, or highlighted with, untraditional colors, so all the beautiful colors aren’t just sitting in the bottom half of your room :) OP: Ah, i see what you mean, i didn’t think of that. thank you! User 19: I love the colour you’ve got going on right now. For the curtains, I would suggest a green or a margenta colour.\n",

Image: a picture of someones feet with dark sneakers. User 1: Yes the white socks look bad. Wear darker socks. The shoes on the right look better. OP: Black shoes, roll up pants OP: There any set way to roll pants up? Any other time I've tried it looked tacky User 2: I usually cuff them by putting my finger on the stitching and rolling up once or twice. OP: Okay, the bottoms are elastic and tighten inward though so idk if itll work. User 3: Yeah don't roll them up if they're elastic/joggers OP: You think they'd look bad if they're a bit baggy? They seem to be in style at my school and I think they look alright but User 3: It's all about creating your style bro, when I wear joggers I prefer a tighter fit that cuffs about 2 inches above my shoes for a more athletic/Euro fit. But as long as you wear something loose on top or a baggy hoodie to match the baggy in the joggers you should be fine 👌 User 2: Nah i thought they were just plain khakis. I bet you could pull them off pretty well without cuffing them User 4: Pants work best with the black shoes. I say black socks. If you don’t have ‘em then no show socks and rolled the hem of the pant. That’s a more summer time look anyway.   Hope this helps. User 2: The pants are ok id say black works best with them. And white socks dont quite work imo\n",

Image: a woman with nails and a purse holds it. User 1: Get a bag because you love it 😀 don't worry if it goes out of fashion, it will come back anyway User 2: It's very much a trendy bag but, in my opinion, it's one of the better designs from Balenciaga. In terms of longevity, I would be concerned about how the bottom corners might wear over time. User 3: OP I feel the same way! I really love how the Hourglass bag has a classic silhouette with a twist and want to get one, but I’m worried as well about the longevity of it. Balenciaga so far only has one true classic bag style (the City) and I’m not even sure how long the Demna era will even last... my plan right now is to keep an eye out for discounts and only buy if there’s a super amazing deal out there User 4: OP as long as you think you'll still love it in 5 years, go for it. Styles are bound to change, but if looking at this bag will make you happy, then don't let that hold you back! User 1: Yea possibly a trend bag but  I see them keeping this style for a few more years so it may become their signature bag as it is a classic handle look - you can't go wrong with a classic colour too OP: yeaaa black is so sleek and i like the shape of it regardless of it is trendy or not, just worried of it looking outdated User 5: If you love it buy it. Worst case scenario you only use it for 2 years and then it looks really dated... but in 8-10 years you can pull it back out and use it again! User 6: I’ve never seen this Burberry bag before but I actually feel like this could easily become an everyday staple bag. It’s a fairly minimal bag but I love the shape - it really sets it apart. It feels different but also like it goes with a lot of things! Idk if I saw it in a vintage shop I would buy it. Just my 2 cents :)  Edit: wow just realized it’s Balenciaga not Burberry... their rebranding has done a number on me OP: yea i want to buy it for the style and not for the brand c: User 7: My mom and aunt had some trendy (back in the day) black leather bags that I'm using 20 years later and I thought it was so cool because nobody would have the same bag as me.

User 5: Yes, the general rule of thumb is about 8-10 inches above the couch so it’s more cohesive and visually connects with the furniture. OP: Thank you!!! I will adjust them -- I had no idea. My thinking was to make them roughly equidistant between couch and ceiling to fill up the wall and not make the top of the wall look empty but that makes total sense!

User 9: Came here to comment mustard yellow as well. Some deep maroonish/purples would also pair beautifully!

Here’s a helpful article by Emily Henderson (former Hollywood set assistant and author of ‘Styled’):   [URL] User 4: I would frame the entire wall with curtains so none of the actual window is covered. I would do a black rod (or bronze), with curtain rings. White curtains will look nice here (IKEA ritva curtains are great, budget friendly and come in several lengths). You’ll want to hem them so they just barely skim the ground User 5: Either all the way to just under the molding and  from wall to wall.  Or an arced rod fitting in the window casing. User 6: Use a track system that attaches to the ceiling.  [URL] User 7: To add to this-- I would go all the way across from the left wall to the right. I would have enough curtains to stack on the bare wall on either side of the window. The window is gorgeous and needs to be framed well. User 6: Exactly! User 8: You could always just put up window film. It adds privacy without blocking the architecture of the window or the natural sunlight User 9: Go with the [roman curtains]([URL] if you want to add privacy with minimal style. They would go perfectly well with the room.\n",
            "User 46 - hcoj71 Original Post: Need help on Kitchen Design without making it feel too small! Curtains, rugs, trash can, and behind the sink in corner are what I’m struggling with currently. Image: a room with a refrigerator, a dishwasher, a window and a trash can. User 1: Instead of a curtain for the wall window, I'd replace the blinds with larger faux wood blinds, [e.g. these]([URL] We installed something like these throughout our house, and it made such a difference!   This will give you lots of light, privacy when you need it, and no curtains in the way of your cooking. No blind cords hanging down either with this model. They are more substantial looking than the current blinds and will give the kitchen a finished look.   You could use them on the door too or use a curtain there if you prefer. User 1: Replacing all 3 blinds in this room would look tidy and cohesive though User 2: My suggestions are 1. buy a rolling island with butcher block on top and storage underneath. IKEA has a lot of styles & when I had a tiny kitchen I loved having extra prep space & I kept my two trash cans underneath (made chopped veggie clean up quick)  2. I like the idea of moving the key holder to the wall (where the rolling butcher block would be too).  3. It looks like you have plants...I think a couple of shelves on the wall where the keys are now would be great for more plants and more storage. They could even go all the way across if you need/want something in front of the window(I hope that part makes sense). OP: Yes love these ideas! I just got rid of my butcher block bar cart because it was a little big for that space. The vent is in a weird place and we can’t cover that up. Will for sure do trash cans on that wall though and probably move the keys. User 1: A stainless steel narrow trash could be pushed up along the long wall. User 3: If you want to inject some color, try changing the splash back to something really vibrant. Then you have a bit of zing without being too overwhelming. OP: It’s brand new construction (wasn’t my first choice but came with the house) and it’ll be a rental eventually so we won’t change that. Still love the idea of injecting color! User 4: There is also temporary back splash that is similar to temporary wall paper that is really easy to remove and doesn’t damage any of the tile and SUPER easy to apply!  edited for: grammar User 5: Not OP but I will be saving this idea for my future rentals to spice up the kitchen! No idea this existed, thanks!! User 6: I put [these stick-and-peel tiles]([URL] up in my kitchen and they are the best. Cheap, easy, and rental friendly/. User 5: Those are awesome- thanks! And perfect timing as I’m moving next weekend User 3: Plus, if you hate the color later on it's just a matter of changing a splashback/blind/decorations User 1: I'd move the key holder to the adjacent wall to give you more open space around the counter. OP: I had some hooks I was going to put there to hang out jackets and aprons! But I think we can fit both! User 1: If you're worried the kitchen looks small, you might put the jackets elsewhere, but the aprons hanging up will be cute! User 7: I agree with no jackets and moving the key holder. Maybe even hang the apron on the side of the fridge? User 1: I like this idea! OP: Yes! Love this User 8: You seem to already have an ideal image of the perfect space for you in mind.   If you really want to increase the “joy factor” you should decorate a space with photos of the people in your home, the frequent visitors, and those whom you love most: family and friends. This will inspire you to cook with care. The area in the corner is perfect if you make use of the vertical space.   Speaking of vertical space, another suggestion I’d make is to store as many things in the cupboards until they’re full to bursting—keeping as much as you can off the counters and floors. That will really lighten the air in your space once you add lightly colored curtains and area rugs. *Make use of the vertical storage in your cupboards by adding wire racks, shelves and storage on the inside of the doors.*   So, a garbage can that’s small enough to tuck away is ideal for any kitchen, and it keeps your trash from rotting over many days too.   -CC OP: Took this advice yesterday and jammed our cupboards! We hate stuff on the counters so if we can avoid it that’s what we prefer. We are the first ones living it after it’s been “flipped” so we were going to keep the floors, backsplash, counters, those are all new.   Love the idea of adding family photos! User 9: I wouldn’t bother with curtains.  But I would say roller blinds over Venetian blinds.  Venetian blinds are dust traps and drive me insane trying to keep them clean  You can get window film, a bit of a twist in a frosted style.  Could be good on the door and the window to the left if privacy is needed.  It’ll let light in.  Floating corner shelving above the sink rather than having everything piled up behind the sink, it will help with reducing the cluttered feel. You could get some nice containers to keep things in to help with storage  Can you get a half moon trash can in the US? They’re available in the uk, a good space saving idea because they push up against the wall  For the rug, maybe a ragrug, something colourful to bring the space to life you can take it with you when you let the place out User 10: I like rag rugs but they’re a trip hazard and a debris trap in a kitchen. User 11: Yeah I came here to say this... speaking as someone who’s seen first hand the result of someone tripping while carrying a pan of boiling water I can confidently state that trip hazards in the kitchen are a bad plan.  Please, don’t do it - a pretty kitchen is not worth melting your skin off half your body OP: Oh goodness thank you for the feedback! Any suggestions on rugs? User 11: My advice would be don't use a rug at all, honestly. I'd rather have a less-pretty, but safe, kitchen than a pretty one that could hurt someone  If you must, then a thin, heavy rug with bound edges and a grippy (eg rubber) underside would be best, to minimise risk of it bunching up or folding over  But really, why take the risk at all? Even if the risk is low, it's higher than without a rug OP: Floating shelves sound amazing! I see the have corner shelve should can install but open to more ideas for this! User 12: Floating shelves for the right corner for plants. I dont have any recommendations for rugs, though. I thought maybe a large round rug but I'm not sure how it would look. User 10: Trash bin under the sink or another lower cabinet, wood cordless blinds  (no curtains), 3 or 4 tier corner shelving behind the sink affixed to the wall (adds storage) and starting right above the backsplash, and rug is completely optional but probably not something I’d consider in this space. You could use a couple colorful foam standing mats in front of the sink and stovetop, though. User 13: I would paint the walls minus the crown molding (keep that white) the same greyish brown as the tile at sink. Do white corner shelving above . So for window near sink, white wooden plantation shutters. Window on door-dark blue tint (silver facing outside) application. Window along wall- large oversized white wood curtain rod white linen curtains. Now optional - wall between door & window long vertical floor to ceiling short 7*shelves. Good for spices, canned goods, wine. Don’t know what to do with trash can yet. Get back to you maybe🤗 User 14: Hanging plant on one of the top corners of the window frame in like a terracotta planter adds a splash of colour and life to the windows - it’s very washed out atm. I agree on some beech or mahogany style wood blinds, some decorative items like a recipe book stand, utensil pot and other things in a colour theme might pop this corner out a bit more. User 15: I have plants behind my corner sink, they make me happy. User 16: At first glance the thing I straight away though was that you had little bench space and agree that you should purchase a stand alone butchers block table that you can wheel away to the side when not in use. User 17: Slim island on casters on the blank wall.  I second checking out IKEA.  Stainless steel trash can with foot pedal lid.  Wood blinds.  And a couple of these:  [URL] User 18: For the kitchen rug, I’d do a long runner style one either leading in from the door with a mat in front of the sink, or keep a mat in front of the door and put the runner in front of the dishwasher/sink area. Something like this:   Kapaqua Custom Size Grey Turkish Kilim Rubber Backed Non-Slip Hallway Stair Runner Rug [URL]\n",
            "User 47 - p1q9v6 Original Post: What do I do with this weird corner pedestal? Image: a living room with a lot of windows overlooking the city. User 1: Greek statue. I would get a bust of Athena. User 2: A bust of Athena's bust User 3: Big plant User 4: Peace Lily, Monstera, Fiddle Leaf Fig  *unless you have a cat, all have levels of toxicity. User 5: Obviously a pole for tiny dancers. User 6: You have some options too, could do a tiny pole for fairy strippers, or a bit bigger for santa's elfs in the off season or go bigger and just say its for midgets. OP: (Relatively) just moved into a new place with this pedestal-type thing in the corner.  Lots of changes to make, but this is one I’m stuck on.  Feel like it could be a decent opportunity, but having a hard time thinking of how best to utilise it, other than just putting a plant on it, as I have been until now.  It’s probably 3 feet high, so about waist-height for me at 6‘3.  EDIT: The corner in particular gets LOTS of light from morning to mid afternoon, so bar isn’t really possibility, after seeing a lot of suggestions. Photo was taken late in the afternoon after light had died down a lot. User 7: A 3 foot tall bust of your own head.   Similar to the pro football hall of fame. User 8: Plants, plants, plants!! Yay plants!   I kinda like the idea of putting some plants there OP: Thinking more plants might be the way to go with the space there, rather than just the one Kentia User 9: Get a large sculpture to go there. User 10: Sculpture and plants. That’s the move User 11: Marble statuette. Gotta be. User 12: A few books and a plant, maybe a light and make it like a “reading nook” User 13: A nice Monstera Deliciosa mate. User 14: Sculpture of your calves.. Gotta honor yourself User 15: Plant? User 16: Coffee bar. User 17: Cat basket. Trust me, I'm a cat. User 18: Bar User 19: Could do a cool vintage rotating table fan too User 20: Get a replica of the SuperLambBanana, and some fairy lights.   That is a great view of the city. User 21: If you drink, then a bar area. Have a few bottles/decanters, nice glasses, wine/glasses, but also - a small neon sign. That would look really cool against the window. Lots of people are saying plants, but won’t that block/take away some of your view? OP: Had thought about some kind of bar thing, but it gets LOTS of direct light in the morning, so maybe that’s a case for adding more plants and against the bar, thinking about it. Would block some of the view, though, yeah. User 22: My only concern with that would be the decanters in a ton of direct sunlight. As I understand thats kinda frowned upon for the booze. User 23: You could possibly even start a fire or burn the spot if light gets directed through the glass correctly. Happened with this decorative glass hexagon my mom had when she was a kid. User 24: Use some empty booze bottles with led lights...mix up with some photographs, a trailing plant or two, small bust of a philosopher or starwars or somesuch hero... DO NOT PUT serious art or booze at that spot as light and temperature fluctuations will, for sure, ruin it. User 25: The answer is plants User 26: A grand piano would be AWESOME!!! OP: Feel we might be over-estimating the amount of space I have to work with, here… User 26: Lmao that's right User 27: The Lego Colosseum. You get to spend 50 hours building it and show it off. User 28: you should put those plants on the floor up on that pedestal. plant will be happy because sunlight. you will be happy because plant User 29: Giant vase or statue of a person or wild abstract art that means something to you User 30: A plant bruv, or art. User 31: a plant is cool... or you can make it your corner bar. put some nice bottles up there and glasses so when ppl need a drink they naturally head over there. User 32: Plants or lamps my friend but it looks like you have a good overhead light there..maybe a display of some type User 33: ALL OF THE PLANTS!!!!   &#x200B;  FEED ME SEYMOUR User 34: Plants! User 35: Obviously question: what’s inside? Can you remove it? OP: Rented apartment, unfortunately, so not a possibility. Also seems to have some electronics inside, as there’s a power outlet on the side, just out of view. User 35: Mmh, I have read the other comments and plant/bar seems the best things you can do with it. My suggestion is to buy a lamp and make a little cozy corner User 36: Wine cellar. User 37: Eh, make the best of it. I could see getting a cool patterned tablecloth / blanket / scarf or something to drape over it and putting a plant or two up there. Maybe a small lamp? User 38: Minibar, photos, plants, decorations User 39: Get  beautiful black shelves and make it a mini bar User 40: A large marble statue. User 41: I reckon a small shelf on the side of it could work out as well. Itcould serve as a place to place books, your remote, more plants, drinks etc. User 42: What about shelves for some books?

            "User 49 - ex9001 Original Post: I would like suggestions for filling all the empty space on my living room wall. Image: the room has a tv and balloons in it. User 1: A bookcase/shelving unit? You can add plants, artwork, books, pics, anything that will help to bring personality! OP: Hmm, What area of the room are you thinking? There is a window to the right of that corner with the lamp.   Maybe there? Maybe if I angled it across the corner it would take up more space. What do you think?  Edit: hey they actually make some that fit in corners. I’ll keep an eye out! User 1: I was actually thinking to the left of the tv in this pic as it’s a little wider? To the right you could put a little low locker like those available from the company mustard, or a side table/console/sideboard you could put a record player on top if you’re into them.   I also like pic rail shelving to put actually on the wall itself. That way you can put up multiple frames of artwork/cards/posters/trinkets and swap them around regularly (or just whenever) and never have to drill any more holes. OP: The carpet has many of the tones present in my couch and  kitchen countertop and cabinets and the room has tile floor. I’m not a fan of the tile at all because it makes the place feel very sterile.  I’d like to cozy the place up, but it’s entirely too spacious and bare at the moment because it is connected to my kitchen leaving a large open area with large empty walls. User 2: Giant wall map of Earth, then low shelves on either side filled with your hobbies and some plants for air quality User 3: Add some stools at the counter, and a poster sized art work above the counter.   Fix your cords if you can so they're not showing.   Ditch the outdated torch floor lamp and replace it with a tall plant. Or you could do an accent chair there in the corner, moved in to the room so the front feet are on rug. You could then get a different floor lamp, one that points down not up.   Consider getting a longer console. Even though your t.v. is the right size for that console, a longer console will give you a surface to place table lamps and other decor including plants. Can also conceal the outlet. One that encloses the peripherals would be nice too for a more streamlined, less cluttered look.   Then do two big pieces of art to the right and left of the t.v. You could do smaller art above the t.v., or leave that area blank. User 4: Just adding an upholstered chair and end table in that corner would help a lot. User 4: Most expensive, time consuming, and turns out enviably: original artwork through Ebay and shopping locally.  I like modern art, so original stuff to my taste tends to be fairly affordable.  I filled a wall about this size over 2-3 years.  Most pieces cost me between $40 and $200, including shipping and framing.  But I still need to frame 3 and reframe 2, and the cost is a deterrent.    Can be a bit expensive, depending: a tapestry.  I bought an elaborate silk embroidered tablecloth in Mexico for $200, but didn't have any real use for it.  My mother sewed matelasse cloth tabs to one end and I hung it on a blank wall.    Saw it in a thrift shop, thought it was brilliant:  a large gallery-wrapped length of patterned upholstery fabric in a frame, around 4x6 feet. User 5: i used to have this bookshelf that i bought at walmart that looked like a leaning ladder. that’d be precious where the lamp currently is. you can find a smaller lamp for cheap to stick on the bookshelf itself to add light that way.   mount the tv if you can to bring more attention up the walls.   i’d put a floor-length mirror to the left of the tv (in the photo) User 6: Where’s your sofa and coffee table? The tv and tv bench are too small for the room which isn’t helping, and the lamp is too tall. User 7: Larger tv, floor standing speakers, subwoofer. That space is literally perfect for a mini home theater. Like... I’m jealous it’s so perfect.  Besides: hanging shelves, corner plant, art. User 1: Get rid of that pink thing . All done here boys pack it up and head out OP: Lol, the pink balloon is the focal point of the room bro! User 1: Lmao grfoh User 8: Can you move tv to right hand wall of photo? Then a sofa could face it. Big bookcase wall would fill this wall nicely. User 9: Mount the television. Where it is.  Above it, centered symmetrically, stretch or have stretched a painting that matches the perimeters of the walls around it but 2-3 ft shorter.....so I'm guessing something like an 5' x 11' painting.  Make it an enamel white with semi gloss.   Divide only the upper left corner of the painting Into simple geometric shapes that reflect/mimic the beautiful combination of colors you have on your floor.  Possibly paint table legs white and separate tv from it's stand, clean it up. Or substitute with a basic Ikea cube like stand. Or a series of them that weigh a little heavy to the left of your center point. Then to the right of stands a tall indoor green plant with clear or white vase.   Think Gustav Klimt metallic and taupe color combination, with a white background and elements. You're working with a great floor to anchor the color heirarchy you use.   Rid the balloons and work the lighting. It would be very clean. :)  IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIo User 10: 2 medium or 3 small pics, centred between the wall and the breakfast bench. And another longer entertainment unit. User 11: I had a large blank wall like this- I got a projector for about $70 on Amazon and I hung string lights on the wall around the projected screen. I made a pretty simple shelf to put the projector on the opposite wall above the couch. Get a snake plant or some succulents for the TV stand/projector shelf. It is soooo freaking cozy and people love coming over to play video games on the projector. User 12: What types of art do you like? If you had a bookcase could you fill it? Do you like any of [this]([URL] stuff? User 13: White-colored furniture. User 14: My living room set up  looked like this as well! My solution was to start by getting a taller/larger more buffet style mid century style entertainment center. Mounted the TV a couple of feet above it, and surrounded the TV with a mosaic gallery wall of artwork I've found or had given to me. I put a 3 ft tall snake plant on a stand on floor on the left side of the console. I have candles, photos and a few small plants on the console top. I think starting with a new TV stand is a good starting point!  Edit: words and things\n",

The black is a bit of a disconnect for me.   They’re both nice styles though! User 3: If planning for spring, white User 4: equally nice.  If you wear a lot of black or prints with black go for black.  If you wear more light colors and floaty fabrics go for white. User 5: White definitely.

User 8: It’s a website www.coolors.co OP: Merci User 9: Sage green , it’ll match the floors User 10: Maybe a nice wallpaper accent wall with neutrals or white to make it pop User 11: Dark forest green User 12: Retro/Dark Green + Retro carpet, curtains and furniture User 9: I like how you think User 12: Take a Look at Etsy. There are beautiful retro/mid century carpets, furnitures and other unique pieces User 12: [URL]  [URL] User 13: A sage green for the upper part would look amazing. User 14: Just my opinion here, but if I had the freedom to choose: black on the wainscoting panels and emerald green on the walls. User 15: Camouflage bro 🤘🏼 User 16: Depending on how much natural light would come in, I would leave the panel white and do the wall light grey or an off white. The contrast between the floor and panelling is beautiful. OP: I had originally planned to paint the wallboard darker but the flooring just looks so good I don't want to f with it. Probably gonna just go an eggshell upper wall User 17: Definitely some type of Green. Mint, Sage, Lime or Dark Green User 18: Cream panels and an olive like green earth tone vibe User 19: light green User 20: What’s your vibe? I love seeing people paint wainscoting one color and the wall overtop a coordinating color! Happy to make suggestions if you tell me what your style is like. OP: I don't believe I have a style tbh. I like hygge User 21: The top half of the walls bright yellow like the sun. Basement apartments need that User 22: A light taupe would go with everything and look great forever. User 23: The bottom - clean white The top - light grey User 24: Something to match the flooring.\n",

Thinking Of buying a smaller sink Image: a small bathroom with a sink, toilet and rug. User 1: Is your entire bathroom the shower? User 2: Lol not OP but yes and it makes cleaning the bathroom 10x easier when everything is the shower lol User 3: I would add a vanity to your sink, which would allow you to store more things. You could potentially have enough space to get rid of the dark storage shelf or your white tp storage. If you're worried about walking through, they make sink+vanity options that face sideways. maybe something like this?  [[URL] OP: I thought about that, but i was concerned how they react to water? Since the showerhead is literally right above it, so it’ll probably get soaked everytime i shower User 3: Oh...I didn't realize the shower was right above...that definitely makes it more difficult! This might be impossible but here's an idea if you're looking to really renovate: put the shower where the toilet is, and bring the toilet out to sit next to the sink. It seems like your toilet is taking up a lot of room since it's at an angle. If you could somehow get your shower-head over in that corner, I think it would make more sense lay-out wise and hopefully give you enough space to have a vanity-sink next to your toilet. OP: [a gif of full view of The bathroom]([URL] User 4: We have a teeny tiny corner sink in our bathroom that doesn't take up any room at all. User 5: Can you replace the open shelves in the back with a much larger storage cabinet? User 6: Yes. Maybe move the mirror over the storage hooks and get a larger cabinet. User 7: You can get a toilet that has the sink integrated in it. If you do that, then reposition the toilet so it's not on an angle, and put the mirror above it.\n",

Room gets really dark at night, hard to get up and down without a flashlight Image: a white painted staircase with a white handrail. User 1: Although it can get pricey and might look a little junky if not done/hidden well, I'd say something like Philips hue lights or just some normal led straps against the wall behind the railing. Not sure if I phrased that right but anything from the ceiling seems like it would be garish as hell, while at least with the Hue lights you could change the brightness and color with your phone for whatever you need. User 2: Yeah or any sort of strip led lighting right under the rails. Or you could go fancy and do strips under the stair lips, would be more effort and more $ but worth User 3: I don’t think it would be that pricey to have an electrician install a switched light up on your ceiling. Permanent and looks better than LED strips. By code you should have a light for those stairs anyway. User 4: Where do you live,  that that staircase passes the building code? User 5: I'd go with these motion sensitive [LED Closet Lights] ([URL]   Just peel and stick them where you need them, no need for a wall outlet and are rechargeable via usb connection. User 6: Maybe some white Christmas lights under the rail?  Or a slide to get down faster? Ha User 7: Jesus Christ I can’t imagine trying to navigate those stairs after a night of drinking User 8: I’ll never forget my buddy and I driving our other friend home one night to his a parent’s house, must’ve been just out of high school. Had to pull over twice so he could puke. We pull in the driveway, each grab an arm and help him into the garage and open the door to his basement. Dark, steep stairs. We just let him go on his own and stood there listening to hear if he made it or not. No loud crashes or falls after a minute, so we bounced. User 9: Led light strip behind tail or down sides of stairs . User 10: Christmas lights or those LED lights people use for twitch streams User 11: LED adhesive lights in the underneath of that railing.  I bought these  Govee White LED Strip Lights,... [URL]  Or can ones that turn colors and flash and stuff   Cheap and effective User 12: Lowe’s or Home Depot sells motion in door lighting.  Some my even be battery powered with 4 aa batteries.  It would go on when you entered the stairs and then go off shorty after.  One at the top and I eat the bottom.  Probably $25 bucks. User 13: might as well get a ladder 😂 User 14: What if you use the same concept that movie theaters use on their stairs.\n",
            "User 57 - nnqe83 Original Post: How can I get the couch and TV closer, but still maintain openness of the room? Image: a living room with a couch a table and some pictures. User 1: Buy a bigger tv User 2: I was going to say the same thing and then mount it. User 3: I would say get a projector OP: Lol for real. It's a 65inch and I can't afford the 77inch version. User 1: Might have to move the couch more center of the room if that helps. Should grab the 80inch lol OP: Was considering moving the couch closer to  the center of the room, but I would just be creating unusable space behind it. But I'm not sure there is really another option. User 4: Get one of those wall mounts that can extend and retract. Will bring the tv closer User 5: This might not work, but can you flip the TV to the opposing wall, and then rotate the couch 90 degrees clockwise? Leave enough space behind the couch (left side of the picture) to make a pathway to that doorway behind it.  It will make a smaller sitting and TV-viewing area, and place the couch closer to the tv. It might break up the room too much and block that exterior French door though. OP: Yeah, that was actually my initial idea, but trying to envision it, I think it would make the room shrink. That seemed like the best idea at first. User 5: One advantage would be that the walking path no longer passes between the tv and couch. It might make the room feel smaller, but it would create two distinct spaces; a tv-viewing space and a “hallway” behind the couch. I think a lot of people have a tendency to push all the furniture against the walls, which can make for awkward spacing. But yeah, sometimes, it’s the only option because the space is already too small. User 6: If the couch connection allows: put the tv on the wall where the couch is, then move the couch to be where the edge of the rug is. You’ll have a corridor to walk to the deck doors behind the couch and you’ll be a couple feet closer. If you wanna mount the tv, you can get an extending mount that you can move in and out while watching or not User 6: If both sides of the couch L are the same, you can just rotate it 90 degrees OP: This was my initial idea, but  do you think it would break up the room too much and make it feel a lot smaller? Was trying to envision it myself. User 6: How about having the L in the complete opposite position currently? Then you’ll have a wide open flow of space from the dining table to the couch area. The rug still sections off the area well User 7: pull the sofa a foot away from the wall User 8: Without replacing the couch, it seems to me it's going to be difficult. User 9: Personally I actually really like this set up.  If it wasn't for that doorway in the corner... I would've put the TV stand on an angle in that corner.  But the way it is isn't too bad.  You could probably get used to it. User 10: Put a console table behind the couch to move it more forward maybe something about 40cm wide   [URL] OP: That's actually a phenomenal idea\n",

Choose simple, minimalistic additions, otherwise it will look cluttered. User 2: Yeah.  I think it looks awesome already!  Get rid of the small side table, and just own the minimalist 80's vibe.  I would add a very present yet simple chandelier or oversized pendant in the middle; maybe hung just a little too low.    You obviously have some taste.  own it! OP: Aw, thank you! I am totally ready to lean all the way into the 80s vibe. The just-too-low chandelier is such a cool idea. Thanks! OP: Thank you! You are so sweet! Good call on the minimalist approach -- with this tile floor, we need to avoid anything that might suggest clutter. User 3: i would do a low open shelving unit on the low divider wall to the left, something like [this]([URL] I'd keep to a walnut finish to match the darker tone of the chair legs.  id keep the mirror where you have it and put a half marble table below it and put some plants or decor there.  for the table i think something like a smaller live edge table would fit the space nicely and change the rug out to a more subdued [afghan]([URL] like so, i think itll accentuate with the walls beautifully. OP: Love these ideas! Thanks! User 4: If you're looking for more space, I'd swap the table for a [round table]([URL]  I like the mirror, but you could add [floating shelves]([URL] on both sides. With a round table, it give you more room to add a [buffet cabinet/console]([URL] under the mirror. I think some [pampas grass]([URL] in a beautiful vase in the right corner would compliment this room quite nicely. The floor seems to have a pattern of it's own, so I would probably stick to a neutral pattern or solid color [rug]([URL] that compliments the green/brown tones. OP: These are fantastic suggestions. Thank you! User 5: Add a long credenza under the mirror with a pair of lamps on either side of the mirror. Replace the recessed light with a chandelier that drops over the center of the table, something interesting that will be reflected in the mirror.   The rug needs to be bigger -- if you are sitting the chair legs are half on/half off the current rug. I like the suggestion of going with a quieter rug since the flooring is busy. You could also do no rug at all.   If they'll fit,  have the chairs side by side on the long sides of the table, rather than at the ends. Not sure they'll fit though-- it looks like the chair legs are competing with each other. If that is the case, you may want to swap out the table OR the chairs for different styles.   If you keep the chairs, you could add sheepskin throws to them to alleviate the green on green effect and also add some comfort as well as texture.   If you keep the table, you could paint it (at least the legs) a bold color. How about orange? OP: Thanks for these ideas! I hadn't thought about adding a chandelier -- that could be fantastic! And you're right about the rug and the chairs. Thanks for pointing that out. I had thought to paint the legs, but at this point I think I just want to find something new. User 6: I like your green walls. The gold framed mirror works well with it, but the walls need some more filling up. Also, the styles don't match very well, with the table and cabinet being more farmhouse and the chairs and rug being more scandinavian.  Swap the table for something more scandinavian looking. You would normally associate this style with light wood, but there is also furniture in darker finishes.   The wall with the mirror is the place to put a credenza/sidboard. Make sure it covers moste of the width of that wall, so it doesn't hide behind the dining table. Stick with the scandi style, but to really make it pop, you may want to go with a lighter colour. I would choose something in walnut and white. Balance the mirror better to the wall by decorating the top of the credenza with plants, candles, and anything else that will fit in a dining area. Bring some more gold into the mix here.   Your rug is does not do on this floor. It is too beige and blends into this highly patterned floor. As has been suggested, you may want to choose a more monochromatic coloured rug. A (off)white rug will work, or something light grey or a very light green. You may also want to consider a larger size rug. OP: Thanks so much for these suggestions! You are totally right about the clashing styles. I want to get rid of the farmhouse pieces in favor of a more scandinavian look. Good call about the length of the sideboard -- that was something I was struggling with. And others have called out the rug, too. I think you're all correct that we need to swap it out. User 5: Follow up to my comment--  Here's some inspiration -- [this dining room has blue walls and a pink painted table]([URL] Imagine your room with green walls and an orange painted table. OP: I never would have thought of this! Thanks for the link! User 5: What I like about this room is those chairs should absolutely not \"go\" with that table. They are totally different styles. Yet painting the table in a wild color makes it work.  I would not paint your chair legs though. That is a very popular Eames-inspired style so don't mess with them in case you want to sell them later. The table on the other hand is something I probably wouldn't hesitate experimenting with. OP: Oh yeah, definitely. I wouldn't mess with the chairs, but the table, why not?! Someone else suggested a round table, and while I think that would probably fit better in the space, I might as well play around with this one to see if I could make it work. OP: I have been struggling to figure out how to arrange this space, so I am bringing my question to you. I have this dining space between the kitchen (to the right -- behind a cut-out wall) and the very 1980s recessed living room (to the left, behind the half wall). The space is 9' wide and around 10' long.  Looking to add storage (a sideboard/ credenza/ cabinet/ bar?) and to replace the $100 craigslist table I bought 5 years and 4 moves ago. Also open to suggestions for the wall with the mirror. I am located in the US and have budget of around $1500. Willing to spend more, hopefully less.\n",

User 1: Tabby keeps getting revamped and reintroduced, which I think proves that the style is here to stay. Fendi has made variations of a baguette for decades now-its not going anywhere any time soon! User 2: Agreed! I think it's shape is quite standard, and design is fairly simple, which lends itself well to having some longevity User 3: If you don't totally love it, don't buy it. The fact that you post this shows you already have buyer remorse and won't enjoy the bag. Maybe better to cancel the order if you're unsure :) User 4: The only thing that gives me pause as to looking dated is that gigantic C hardware. I wish companies would have subtler branding. User 5: I’d buy so many more bags if they didn’t have their logos plastered everywhere. I probably would’ve even gotten the Marc jacobs tote bag if it didn’t say Marc jacobs tote bag User 6: They make a version without the monogram but yes I agree User 4: Without the gigantic C hardware? Or are you talking about the fabric? I honestly don't mind the fabric, but that hardware is too much for me; maybe if it were thinner and smaller, it would look nicer, but it just looks like a balloon animal. User 6: I misread your comment sorry! The Cassie 19 looks similar to this but with a much more understated logo! User 4: Yes, I prefer Cassie 19 hardware. User 7: I agree. I think the huge C is just way too much. User 8: This will always look similar to a vintage bag. It's really up to you if like vintage or not User 9: It’s timeless. I prefer the leather version without the monogram C print, but it’s not that bad on the Tabby! Baguette bags will always be in style. User 10: It already looks dated. But in a retro way. So it depends on if you like it. User 11: Hi! I got this in brass/dark stone last week and I love it. It’s so functional with the two straps. It fits a lot of things surprisingly. And it’s light. I’m really happy with it. I’m more of a neutral colour person and not a big fan of logos so that’s why I picked the solid colour one. Never been a Coach person but when I saw it I was so impressed with the stitching and quality so I had to buy it. I think yours looks great as well as long as you’re okay with the logo design in the middle. User 12: I got the tabby top handle 20 which is essentially the same with this one. It looks quite nice and very well made! It doesn’t have anything super trendy on it IMO, so probably won’t look dated anytime soon.  Go for it! User 13: I think it just depends on your preference for canvas. Some like it some don’t. I think this purse is super cute and can be dressed up or down! User 14: I have two - a black and a white. The Tabby gets new versions every now and then. If you like wearing neutral colours, it will surely be timeless. It looks good on whites, browns, and blacks. User 15: It’s classic and looks very nice. You should try to separate your taste from what is trending now and what won’t be trendy later. If you really like a bag, you’ll wear it even if it’s not a timeless peace. User 16: Don't worry! Once it's in your hands, it may be spark joy.  If not, you can always return it 🤗\n",

I think the necklace might be a bit much, maybe try something more dainty or perhaps long earrings instead of a necklace. I think earrings will keep there focus on the dress more OP: Yes I think you’re right. I’m definitely not a “less is more” person so sometimes I feel naked without a lot of accessories haha. But I do think long earrings would look nice here User 2: Indoor or outdoor wedding? If indoor bring a shawl because you might get cold in the AC. OP: Hmm I’m actually not sure lol, all I know is that it’s in the afternoon at a country club. I’m hardly ever cold though unless it’s like 20 degrees out haha User 3: I would make sure to have a wrap/shawl/sweater no matter the weather... OP: Why is that?

            "User 61 - ac84je Original Post: I got rid of a ton of stuff in my bathroom. Now it looks like we just moved in. How do I spruce up the shelves? Image: a corner shelf with several items in it and a picture on the wall. User 1: On 2 shelves - Use decorative baskets - ideally 1 or 2 baskets on each shelf that take up most of the opening. Do this instead of the plastic bins.  On 1 shelf put 4 large matching towels folded neatly.  On top shelf you may want to put something decorative - like a pretty box or 3 vases.    User 2: Consider rolling the towels instead of folding them to go with the rounded edges of the shelves.  User 1: Yeah, that’s a great idea. User 3: Maybe add pictures in one shelf, towels in another, decorative baskets in another, and everything else in the last User 4: Try to hide anything with branding labels   Plants would look nice here too  User 5: Decorative boxes from Ikea can help along with some small display items or pictures. Fake or real plants (like succulents) could also add a touch of color.  Boxes from Ikea [URL]   User 6: Little plants if you have light in there!  User 7: You need two things - texture (towels, face cloths, washcloths, a painting) and life (potted plants or succulents). User 8: Rolled towels on the shelves? Practical but decorative.  Make your everyday items more decorative - decant mouthwash into a pretty vessel etc.  Like the plant idea.  User 9: If you can, I would paint the back and inside walls of the shelves User 10: Agreed, it would be a great spot for a fun color like turquoise or the like.  User 1: That would look amazing. User 11: How do the shelves correspond with your height? Depending on the height of the second and third shelves, add a small mirror with an area for skin and hair products at eye level. Even if you already have a mirror in the bathroom an additional reflective surface is functional adds depth to a small space. Then put at least one small potted plant on the mirror shelf with a decorative bathroom piece, such as a diffuser or a box with hand towels. Directly below this shelf, place a tray to put your toothbrush and small toiletries on. Fit three/four boxes snuggly into the remaining shelf that is not the top shelf. Wood crates or wire baskets will have a nice contrast with the white wood depending style of the rest of the room. Fill these boxes with toilet paper, extra toiletries or even nothing, just make sure to fill the space. If you don't want to see through the gaps in the boxes you can buy or DIY slip bags to fit inside the boxes and conceal the contents. Finally, finish the top shelf with potted plants and ambient light. Real candles will likely burn the wood, but battery powered candles or a salt rock lamp might look nice (albeit a little hippy-ish). ZZ and Snake plants are low maintenance, they will grow with little to no natural light as and thrive with infrequent watering.   Cool bathroom fixture! The shelves are so unique, can't wait to see what you do with the space.  User 12: Baskets of various sizes and shades. Textural yet practical. User 13: If it's not a rental, you can pry off that curved trim, re-touch, re-paint. Then get some matching linen cubes to fill the shelves. Or add a door so it all disappears.   Otherwise I like the idea of rolled towels in here. User 14: A nice plant, a reed diffuser User 15: Add towels and take a look at r/skincareaddiction OP: My skincare is in the closet on a roll cart now :)  User 16: Plants?  OP: No light :(  And it’s a small bathroom so it gets realllly steamy or I’d consider fake  User 17: Put a plant on the top one.  Space your stuff evenly on the lower shelves and it'll look nicer even without fancy baskets. User 18: I love how the openings are shaped! I think you should showcase those by painting them a different color and then buy some decorative boxes to store toiletries and spruce it up with small bathroom friendly plants.  OP: Get some toothbush caps, cause everytime you booboo, booboo particles are released and get on everything.  User 19: You have to be joking...\n",

Image: a girl in a gown is looking at her phone. User 1: I think that specific tiara will overshadow you and it will be the only thing people are talking about.  You want them to be talking about you.  A *delicate*, gold tiara with that dress would be stunning.  Some kind of a cape in lieu of a veil would also be very chic. User 2: I do think it’s a little costume-y. I like them both separately but together not really. How do you plan on actually having your hair? OP: I’m not sure yet. I have a hair trial on Tuesday so maybe I’ll bring it and have the hairdresser work with it to see if we can do something that works— I’ll post pic updates and see if the reaction is different— without hair and makeup it could be difficult to tell User 2: Yeah that’s what I’m thinking! Honestly it may just be the color of the dress that’s throwing people off, it’s a lot of gold all together. I look forward to seeing the update! OP: Thanks! I was sort of hoping the pearls would add a hint of white, maybe with hair done it will look a little different. User 3: It might look different if you had a tall updo? User 4: I don't think they coordinate very well and the effect is, as you put it, costumy. id go with a shorter tiara without pearls. User 5: I’m going to be honest. It giving Statue of Liberty 😅 OP: I sort of feared this User 6: i thought the same, sorry User 7: Was about to write this exact comment word for word. User 8: Love the dress. Smaller tiara. User 9: It’s always best not to guild the lily. When the dress is fancy best to go simple with accessories. This kind of gives me a Queen of England vibe. Unless royalty is the theme, better to dial it back a little. User 10: the dress on its own is great. it fits you really well and even unaltered looks awesome! But the tiara is pretty bad (sorry). If youre going with a gold gown, you need to keep your accessories a bit simpler (imo). User 11: Gorgeous dress, definitely tiara worthy but not one with big balls. You need a dainty diadem and a cape veil also in gold would be awesome. User 12: Yessss I agree with this! Diadem is actually a more suitable head piece for this dress ⭐️ User 13: I agree that it does look a little costume-y. But if you like it that’s all that matters. ❤️ User 14: I’m all for a tiara but not *this* tiara. It does give it more of a costume look.   The dress is lovely and already stands out so I’d opt for a quieter tiara or headband - something that won’t fight with the dress. User 15: I like the tiara and I think you should wear one! But I don’t like the tiara with this dress User 16: You know what, it’s unusual, but I love it. You look like a queen! OP: Thank you!! It’s a big statement so it’s a little nerve-wracking pulling the trigger on this. User 17: It looks very \"Anastasia\" to me, and I am ALLLLL for that, especially for a December wedding! User 18: Once upon a December!!! User 19: Absolutely love the dress. I think you need to go with a simple tiara, though. A more delicate one would look lovely with it. User 20: I think the tiara itself feels a *teensy* costume-y but I love this dress and the vibe of the overall ensemble. User 21: I like it, it’s giving me medieval queen vibes. Very unique and memorable in a good way! At the end of the day, the traditional big princess dress with the cathedral veil is also very costume-y. OP: Thank you for this! I know people have said that all wedding are costumey but I didn’t consider the fact that so many brides want to look all “princess-y” which also comes off as kind of a costume, but it’s more accepted because it’s more of the norm. I was kind of thinking “I don’t want to be a princess, I want to be a queen 👸🏻” lol User 22: My thoughts exactly!  I personally love it. I think you should totally lean into the golden queen vibe. Memorable and unique and dramatic!      I would pair it with a fairly simple updo, with some volume, and then a white silk chiffon, silk gauze, or silk tulle veil flowing down behind the crown for a slightly opaque look! User 23: I don't think they complement each other. The dress is lovely and would benefit from a more understated headpiece. User 24: I don’t want to confuse things, but I’m actually kind of obsessed. It reminds me of the runway or the MET gala a few years back. This with like a dark lip and dewy, glowy makeup 🤌🏼 But, that’s if you want drama! I think it’s you’re day and you should do whatever you want. User 25: I don't like thetiara, the pearls are too big and distract from the beauty of the dress. It reminds me of the statue of liberty. User 26: I see in your comments OP that you want to feel like a queen. You most definitely look very regal in your dress with this tiara 👑 if it makes you feel amazing then go for it! Your dress also looks stunning on you! User 27: So unique and fun AND beautiful. It looks a little bit costume-y but I think a lot of that has to do with the dress being a little bit big. Once you get the dress altered everything will look more cohesive and elegant and I would love to see the result!!! OP: Thank you! I think once the dress is altered it will have a much different effect User 28: Love it!! What other event can you wear a tiara?? Go for it and it looks lovely!! User 29: I like it, fits the dress. Wear it with confidence and you'll be radiant! User 30: I love this look. It's got a vintage vibe to it and the headpiece is perfectly paired. It's not the same old thing, so you'll be really striking at your event and people will remember it fondly I'm certain. OP: This is my hope! Thank you! User 31: My exact thoughts User 32: Love the dress, the tiara, and the combination!!! User 33: I think all wedding outfits are costumes. This look is fire and you should go for it! User 34: I love the dress and think it's doing great things for you, but I don't think the tiara works with it. The dress is a statement piece, but the tiara is trying to be a statement as well (a totally different one). At first glance, the large pearls looked like light bulbs to me, possibly because the white really sticks out compared to your coloration and the dress's.

Image: a small, brightly decorated living room with rug, couch, coffee table, and windows. User 1: First, let me just say, I love this room.   Personally, I'd go [round]([URL] You're gonna have to be really careful about sizing though. Make sure you measure and re-measure before you settle on a table. User 2: I agree, round and possibly white (edit: or glass) to add a bit of fresh. Ikea have some lovely ones.  Also nice space!  Edit: have now been convinced by u/hailzzzy 's modern wicker idea User 3: I agree on a round coffee table. User 4: I have no input, just here to say this room is so cute! User 5: [[URL]  &#x200B;  I really like this one but it might be a tad too big. But a round table would be nice, too. Nice room :) User 6: Just wanted to say this is such a cool coffee table!! Do you happen to know if this company ships to the U.S.?! The real wood and details is amazing User 5: They don't seem to, unfortunately. The company is based in Hamburg, Germany. I've got this exact table and I love it! Another good reason to live in the EU right now... (I'm sorry) User 7: Goddamn this would be perfect. Maybe op can find something similar User 5: I know, right!? User 8: Kidney shape mid century style alll day long 🤩 User 9: I love this one (if you’re American and have access to the wonderful world of Target!) [Target round wicker table ]([URL] User 10: This is the only acceptable round offering User 2: Oh actually this is gorgeous. Wish we had Target in the UK User 11: Needs to be round User 12: Something round!  [URL] User 2: Yes! This is what I was thinking too with my earlier comment User 13: I’d say round and shiny like glass! Very cute space btw User 14: I think round makes sense, but really it depends on how you use it.  e.g. if you use the table to play boardgames or do puzzles or as a workspace, you might want something square or rectangular.  Or maybe one of those mid century expanding tables for when you need a bit extra. User 15: Steamer trunk User 16: maybe something like this but the color of your trim on the walls  [[URL] User 17: A round upholstered ottoman so you can put your feet up! User 18: I was also going to suggest an ottoman with a large thrifted tray — beautiful space. Love all the colours and textures. User 19: Round storage ottoman - we always need more storage! User 20: This one is the perfect size for the space. Plus, storage! [URL] Also, your room is adorable! The colors and light reminds me of the room from David Lynch's short film \"Rabbits!\". User 21: I LOVE this for the room but it looks a little long . Such a nice choice though User 22: I would go clear User 23: I love the rug!! User 24: To balance out the round coffee table suggestions I think rectangular could also work, especially with rounded corners and a 'light' frame.  Something [like this]([URL] Although personally I'd invest in time to find a cheaper version rather than invest in this table. ;) User 25: I absolutely love this room. Something similar in that spot, maybe from a thrift store would be awesome. A round portait photo on the wall on the right could also be nice but your room looks good as is User 26: SO nice room.please try to replace the [carpet]([URL]) to match you room well.🙂  Can.t waiting for your next share.😄 User 27: I was initially going to say a dark wood, triangle shaped table with gold legs to match your curtain rod, and other golden accents around the room.   But then I found this small trio of [tables]([URL] that I think would fit nicely in this room. And it’s very practical if you have someone in the chair and on the couch, everyone can have their own table. User 28: Everyone is saying round, but I think oval would be better. A round one would take up too much space and there would be less usable space for people sitting on the ends of the couch, where most people typically sit. Oval all the way. User 29: I’d say get a funky triangular one! User 30: White or Swiss coffee color with similar size. it will bring the top white colors down and draw a natural tendency to look at the whole space (up and down)  If not, if you continue with a brown or dark colored table, add a white or light colored rug underneath. I’d say a faux fur one. But they’re not the funnest to maintain User 31: I think a long, narrow table would look great. Even a long oval. I think it would look smashing mirrored. User 32: See if you can find an antique trunk or chest with a flat top.  I just got a cedar chest with wheels.  It's great storage. User 33: That ark/ truck ffit very well in the room, and you already know that now. So my suggest will come in a different style. Try a Tulip Table. Is rounded, without legs (one base), and it has several choices for its top, like plastic fiber or marble. I would say white with marble top. The window will be smiling with a little string light hanging from above. User 34: Hang a [large abstract wall art]([URL])  on the wall behind the sofa.\n",

User 1: It's time to get rid of the dichotomy and stop worrying whether something looks \"masculine\" or \"feminine\". They're just social constructs. OP: You are so right! I just had someone dislike the white puffy clouds because they were too feminine for him. So......Just thought I'd get your ideas as a come back. LOL User 2: Well, he IS going into a female living space…so it sounds like he needs to re-evaluate his own sense of masculinity if his is that fragile.   Seriously…who even picks the WALL ART and not that bedspread paired with fairy lights?? Are you just trolling? It’s ok, you can tell me.  Also, those look like storm clouds to me. Decidedly manly. OP: no trolling. Just asking a question that resulted from a comment.  I change art around all the time as I am a painter and like to see the art in different places. Lights are just for fun here and there or nowhere. I think decorating is a living breathing activity. User 3: I don’t think so.

I may try them and post again.

User 1: Needs some character on the wall. Just cause he’s 13 doesn’t mean it needs to be tacky either. Get some cool art OP: Thanks, would posters do the trick? Or should I install wall shelves for my books and LEGO builds. User 2: I bet he'd appreciate shelves if he likes Legos.  Why not ask him? OP: I am him User 3: This is hilariously funny to me. User 4: whoosh User 5: It is great that you're interested in creating your space at your age.  &#x200B;  There are a lot of things you can do to make it more interesting. I might spend some time looking for ideas on [Youtube]([URL] While a lot of what you'll find may look girly, it's worth a look because the colors can be changed from pink and yellow to more dude colors and use more masculine materials, like natural rope or wood. If you find one cool idea you can adapt for your own room, it's was worth the watch.  What works well in a lot of youth bedrooms is [Bulletin boards]([URL]  When I was 13 (a budding interior designer) I cut out images from magazines and \"framed\" them with black poster board (you can get it at the dollar store or staples) I used [spray adhesive]([URL] (sometimes called photomount)  to glue the picture without wrinkles. I space the picture in the corner of the board, leaving an inch or so around the edges, and pencil mark the corners. Then spray the back of the picture (laid on newspaper) and smooth it in place and then cut out the other sides. It elevates something you printed from the internet. Use push pins (not thumbtacks) to hang (the holes actually fill with paint, when you repaint).  What I have seen work well is a horizontal band painted around a room, like a high water mark, maybe 2.5 ft. to 3 ft. wide and the bottom level with the desk top. this is an area where you can pin art and what ever, maybe even add a couple of hat hooks. Use painters tape to mark the top and bottom and remove the tape before the paint drys (if the paint completely drys the tape chips the edges).  I am not a fan of black and white color schemes, but it seems a lot of guys are. But, I would encourage you to introduce color.  The bed could be elevated, with a homemade [pallet board bed frame]([URL] It's a good first time woodworking project.  Lights help decorate a space more than anything. You should be aware of three kinds, General (overhead, floor lamps bounced off the ceiling or walls), Task (desk lamp, night stands, end tables) and mood (candles, small lights, sconces, [string lights]([URL] Even back-lighting furniture, like placing [Monster illuminessence lights]([URL] behind an open bookcase). Your workspace could benefit from a desk lamp.  Anything you do will be an improvement, so don't worry about trying things out, everything can be undone and redone. Look at your room as your \"design laboratory\" where you can try out different ideas.  hope that helps. User 6: Black accent wall with diagonal stripes in like grays and whites. Make the art pop. Also very DIY-able and would make a good weekend project for under $75 (USD) User 7: Need a headboard for that bed.  A mirror for the wall, unless the dresser already has one.    A basic classy video gaming print, framed. Or whatever his hobbies are.  I prefer to keep walls neutral and accent with wall pieces.  The wood floors ground it all pretty well.  Maybe a chest/foot locker for the end of the bed, doubles as a bench. User 8: Agree about the art work. Also pick the bed off the floor and get a headboard, etc. User 9: Headboard for the bed. Framed Print(s) above the bed. Floating shelves above the desk with some drooping plants (+ your lego). Bedside table with a cool lamp. User 10: Get some LED light strips on amazon. The ones with the sticky stuff on the back so you can just tape it onto whatever you want with no problem. They look super cool and are a good way light your room up. User 4: ask him what colors he wants and paint the walls, white is dreadfully boring in a small room like that. Maybe put up wall shelves by the computer desk if he has stuff he wants to put on display. Also 100% agree with getting a headboard for the bed and art for the walls like other people have been saying.  And finally because it's basically an obligation for someone to bring this up in the comments of every /r/malelivingspace thread, a plant on the desk would look really nice if that's something he'd want. OP: I like the white and there is a bookshelf under the picture and another slightly to the left of this picture out of shot. User 11: Shop around for a rug that you think looks cool.  * Get paintings/prints (with affordable frames if you have the money) and place them where you wish there was a window. * Get low light plants. * With [Planters]([URL] * Place a rug or rugs.  [With color.]([URL] * Get colorful [throw pillows]([URL] for sofa or bed or even a chair.  There’s a million online. * A Bookshelf than can hold [both books and also visual objects]([URL] like plants, colorful antiques, gadgets, sculptures, art.  My tips are for adults, because kids can’t usually afford planters or bookcases, but I’m not going to dumb it down for you my friend.  That’s the truth.  And plants are cool.  Black chairs are common, but they are drab and not very fun.  I like light colored chairs.  But this can be a waste of money if your chair feels fine.  . . And get on **Pinterest** for interior design.  Reddit is god-awful for stuff like this.  The [sub for femalelivingspaces]([URL] is also really good, women seem more creative at throwing together the right elements on average if you compare both subs.  And the results aren’t “female” in any exclusive way, the results are excellent brilliant interior design in general. User 5: Or skip pinterest, a site that encourages people to steal from other sites, and use the good ideas you find on this fine sub. User 3: I'd run a shelf all around the room about 2 feet down from the ceiling, then put stuff on it-- storage, plus decorative if styled nicely.  You like the white, that's fine! Just add color and texture elsewhere-- pick a palette (you've got the black and white already, add two colors-- red or yellow and orange, if you like things vibrant, or blue and green if you like things a bit cooler/more calm).   A better bedframe would transform the bed, plus give storage opportunities under the bed and even in the headboard, if you got a bed frame that had a shelf-y-type headboard.  An area rug would warm up the floor figuratively and literally. Nice big art in black frames would look great against the white walls. I'd add curtains in your red/yellow/orange or blue/green tertiary colors, to soften and give light and privacy control. Chuck a few plants in there, and it's done! OP: Would posters, bed frame, and colorful bed spread do the trick? User 3: They'd be a good start, as long as the colors coordinate. Get a bedframe in metal (black iron? oiled bronze?)  and a bedside table (you can use a stool or flat-seated chair, if you can't get an actual little table or cabinet-style thing with a drawer) and stick a lamp on it, maybe a small plant? You can get them cheap in a lot of supermarkets.  I suggest you take your favorite poster and pick 2 colors from it, one color not too bright (so like dark red or navy blue or forest green) and then something bright. Get the bedspread in the not-bright color and a throw pillow in the bright color. Maybe the lamp or lampshade could be the bright color, too.   If you end up getting curtains at some point, stick to plain white OR the solid not-bright color OR a print/pattern that has the not-bright and bright colors in it.  It can be a work in progress, okay to put it together one bit at a time over the course of a few months.\n",

It gets hot in the afternoon sun so I have a double curtain rod with black out in front and sheer in the back right now. User 9: is that a window or a sliding glass door? If its a window, you should be able to set your sectional in front of it and then put your tv on the opposing wall. which will open up space to the right of the tv for an accent chair. It will also make your room look a lot bigger  edit if you go with this route, plant in the left corner, accent right corner near entry way and large rectangular horizontal mirror on left wall along with framed artwork  edit 2: didnt see dog bed, put that on the bottom right corner User 13: Plants User 14: I saved this to my references/inspirational faves so.. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ User 6: I would suggest a large piece of art above the TV, obviously keep it in theme.

Handsome, tall plants User 19: If possible, I think the dog bed in the corner would be a great spot for some sort of house plant. Some shelves above the T.V. and a different color accent wall might also help. Overall it looks really good man. User 20: Plants Hang your tv on the wall User 21: Wall mount the tv User 22: I just want to say  really dig that circular shelf. User 23: It looks great! My only comment is that the white wall looks a little heavy with the lamp, couch, and 3 pieces of art on it. I'd wallmount the TV and put some books/pictures/plants underneath it (a piece of driftwood might look cool actually!) and then hang something to the left of the TV.  Even the woven wall hanging you've got on the white wall would look good. Otherwise, as someone else suggested, a taller floor plant or hang a vine plant like an ivy, pothos, or philodendron from the ceiling in the corner maybe? User 24: All it's missing is plants imo User 25: P L A N T S ! User 2: Move that dog pillow or whatever it is somewhere else  &#x200B;  Get a plant (snake is good there) and put it where the pillow thing is  &#x200B;  Ribba picture ledge (long) and some framed artwork and little things above the tv set would work. You could put one of those deer antler things a lot of hipsters have above it all to match the deer on the wall if you want to accentuate height.  &#x200B;  I think you could do with a bigger rug but after spending coin on my own little one I know how that goes wrt bigger rugs being $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ User 26: I really like it.  As someone pointed out, I think you could use something above the TV  - could be a painting, shelving, etc. (kind of like [this]([URL]  Also, I'd add a plant somewhere near where you've got that brown pillow (or dog bed?) on the ground.

User 4: Check out Lamps Plus for ideas on attractive flush mount fixtures. User 5: Look for semi-flush mount lights.

            "User 70 - gpwcqm Original Post: My dining area doesnt have any Windows, it's not a separate room but sort of part of the hallway. I'm good at diys and would like to stay on a budget Image: a living room with a table, chairs and guitar wall hangings. User 1: Looks great! Just some simple suggestions below. Will you be painting the walls at all?   Larger rug. When you pull the chairs out they should still be on the rug.   Buffet cabinet under the mirrors and you can make it your bar area.   The mirrors need to be painted because they blend into the wall. Or remove them and turn the pic the other way.   Frame those albums with matting to really make them stand out.   Put a big bowl in centre of table and fill with your fave fruit you can grab on your way out biking. OP: We decided not to paint since the walls are so high and the white kinda keeps it bright. When I bought the rug I figured it was too small damn it, the space isnt really bigger than what's in the picture, should the rug still be small enough to not touch the corners of the room??   Also, what color should I use to paint to mirrors? I really want to keep them because they brighten up the room during the day. User 2: Definitely don't let the rug touch the walls, but it could be closer to the walls if you got a bigger one User 3: I would either go with the orange of your guitar for a pop of color or the blue of your chairs. User 4: So looking at it right now, the distance it is away from the back wall with the mirrors but should be roughly that distance away from the other two walls. If I were to make a rough guess, yours is a 5'x7' or 6'x8' rug - you'd want to go one size up like a 7'x9'.   Colorwise on the accent wall, you could go with an orange or yellow that matches your guitars. User 5: I have no skills I can lend it to your attempt to rethink the look of your room, but one immediate thought was that you might want to take the strap off of the Sunburst guitar to the left, it makes some thing which should be really sleek and beautiful look a little bit cluttered. Just a thought, hope it helps!  (Also, I’m super curious: is that guitar on the left a Fender Jaguar?) User 6: It's a jazzmaster, can't tell the make User 7: Toanzmaster OP: As Simeone said, its a jazzmaster haha. My boyfriend plays it almost every day during the quarantine that's why the strap is on, but I'll keep it on mind! User 8: This is a large room with high ceilings. Each piece in this room is just a bit too small. To make it look balanced I would suggest taking down the small pieces of art as well as the small mirrors and exchanging then with much bigger pieces, and center the table and light a bit more, and add a credenza along that wall with the mirrors on it. A larger rug for sure, one that's not so dark. Maybe with some light blues and yellows. Even if u hung all three of those small squared pieces one on top of the other in a column to the left most part of that wall and then added some larger pieces or something. :) OP: I'm definitely going to get a bigger rug then.  They are actually records not pictures! We wanted to get more record frames and rearrange them User 9: I would be impressed by your place just seeing the Grace album c: User 2: I actually don't mind the rug, but there are indeed items that are clashing and the rug may not work with future configurations.   The first thing I notice is that your lovely teal chairs get a little lost in the different colors going on, and the lack of another similar teal to tie them in to the room. I would suggest perhaps painting the frames of the mirrors a similar blue, or change the art in between the mirrors with some tie-in colors. Something like [this]([URL] might look cool!  The overhead lighting is really nice but since there's no windows in the corner, it wouldn't hurt to add some more. A couple [wall sconces]([URL] where the mirrors currently are could look good, or one in between them, or one on the other wall. You can get some plug-in sconces that have nicely designed cords so that it looks tidy.   As for your music wall, cool, love it, personal, spices things up, etc., but I'd just suggest some symmetry. Doesn't necessarily have to be square, but symmetry is much more visually appealing, in my opinion.   And then maybe pop a big leafed green houseplant in the corner! Apparently philodendron are fairly low-maintenance.   These are just my suggestions and based on what I like! :) User 10: anyways here wonderwall... User 11: I love how the chandelier casts such interesting shadows on the ceiling, but I wish the chandelier was much much larger and more impactful.  Yes to larger rug. Or no rug.   Took me awhile to realize those were mirrors-- I thought the one on the right was some cool bicycle art. Heh. So here's an idea. Lower all three pieces on that wall a bit as they are too high and seem to be floating not grounded. Move the mirrors in closer to the art, to ground them in association with the art. Then paint the mirror frames orange like your guitar, or fire engine red, or maybe bright yellow. Something unexpected. Then paint on top of the mirror -- freestyle shapes, squiggles, lines, splatters or dots. I mean those are just garden variety mirrors you find at Target right? So why not turn the mirrors into DIY art? Unleash your inner child and finger paint them! Leave some of the mirror showing -- [example]([URL] OP: It actually looks kind of cool!  We got the mirrors because the room was so dark during the day and they help brighten it up, do you think they would have the same effect? User 12: In my layman’s eyes, I feel like everything looks too small for this room.  I would exchange the two mirrors with one huge one that could reflect your “biking” area, which seems aesthetically pleasing from what I can tell.  It also adds a bit of personality to the space.  The rug should be bigger too.  I would get a rug big enough so that when you pull the chairs back, it will still be on the rug.   Left wall arts, I would also exchange them for something bigger or I would add way more images like that to cover a bigger area.   When you say DIY, can you build your own furnitures? I reckon it would be cool if you could build a nice little wooden console to place to the side where you can leave your drinks / condiments etc when you’re having a big meal. OP: I actually did the top of that table :). I was trying to get a big mirror but it was waaaaay out of my budget and we ended up getting 2 smaller ones and we made that painting. I'll look up those wooden consoles. The things on the left wall are actually records User 13: Essentially - the mirrors need to be more visually interesting (to balance the guitar wall), and the rug needs to be bigger (to make the chairs looks less crowded). If you take the strap off your starburst there it will improve that wall too. The light shade is too lightweight for this area, it will be improved if it's visually heavier or more interesting (to balance the rug).   DIY ideas - make the mirrors look like windows (google \"mirrors that look like windows\" and you'll see what I'm getting at). Also, buy some old traditional style rugs, and patchwork them together - it would even work if you found a bunch of old rugs with holes in them, cut them apart, dyed them awesome colours, and patched them together - if you google \"patchwork rug\" you will see if this look is for you. Lastly, the light shade - see if you like any really colourful light shades in an image search. There is always inspiration to be found there - I saw a half-globe, some feathery ones, and I thought maybe even if you use the same shade you've got but hang colourful guitar picks from it?  With diy skills you have so many options, and with a funky musician vibe there is so much you can do. Enjoy!! Good luck!! User 14: Put a good size mirror on the wall that can reflect a window. Then hang some plants or put in a shelf in that area too. There are plants that will do fine without direct sunlight. User 15: Take down the mirrors.   Larger rug.   Maybe paint the table legs a contrasting color. User 16: Something I'm going to do is add vinal records User 17: If you like plants, you might want to consider a large faux plant to add some color like [this]([URL]  one. OP: I do love plants and we have a LOT but I cant figure out which large one I could get that survives in here, a snake plant seems a bit too boring User 18: I personally wouldn't have any real plants in a room with no light. I'd just have fake ones because 1hour of lighting isn't enough for any plant.   I think waxy types look more realistic than leafy types but you can get fake trees, ferns, birds of paradise, monstera. Big glossy leaves look more real to me. User 14: Put a good size mirror on the wall that can reflect a window. Then put some plants on the shelf that are not too overwhelming in size. There are plants that will do fine without direct sunlight. Maybe put a guitar on either side of the mirror. But make sure you also have things on the wall that will balance the mirror wall. OP: I'll give the plants a try! Sadly there is no wall that could reflect a window User 19: i would suggest adding bigger/longer mirrors and maybe flipping the painting in the middle. you could add more albums higher up to fill in the space on the other wall as well User 20: Gosh I love it just as it is.  Maybe a different rug tho. User 21: Add things on the floor like large plants or those slender side tables or cabinets against a wall User 22: You have a a great room with lots of wonderful suggestions already. I do think a bigger rug would help a lot. If you decide to do a rug, I think you should do something [like this]([URL] and really play up the guitars and chairs, which will help brighten the room up as well. I would add an oversized, colorful mid-century clock that takes up the mirror wall (couldn’t find a great example, but please ask more questions if needed!). You could also get a third mirror, paint the framing red and stack them horizontally on the wall. For the guitar wall, you could frame the three albums (like someone mentioned) and place them in a row, then use picture lighting (like museums have) to highlight the albums. Or if you have more albums, then you could turn it into an album gallery wall. So many fun options. I’d just play with various ideas and have fun with it. A colorful, mid-century style would be awesome in this dining room though! OP: Thank you! I feel like the type of rug you recommended would really give it a more mid century look! I also like your idea with the mirrors User 22: Yay! You’ll have to post what you end up doing after all these comments! OP: Larger rug. Bigger table. Maybe a contrast wall or even a curtain wall. Bar cart. User 23: I think it would look nice with a larger rugs. Maybe one of those large mirrors that have window trim User 24: It looks perfect the way it is now. User 25: It looks like some Moulding or something just barely in frame at the left mid side of the photo, can you show more what the rest of that wall looks like? It'll be easier to suggest balancing the guitar wall when we can see the rest! User 26: Larger rug for sure User 27: It looks like everything is crammed into the corner.  I know that there's probably more floor space on the left because it's part of the hallway, but based on the length of the wall on the left it looks like it's still kind of crammed into the corner.  I would try pulling the table further away from both walls and consider moving the guitars/records on the left wall so they're more spaced out along the wall. User 28: Something nobody mentioned yet, but do something about the lighting! Start with another chandelier, which projects the light to the ceiling (instead of down), creating nice indirect light. Additionally, add some self standing lights, maybe in the corner, or on a credenza. I would say the current setup is good functional lighting but does not create an atmosphere. You could also play with a piece of artwork (photo) that is back-lit, which would act as a type of window. User 29: I think a larger rug and hang a large mirror horizontally centered with the table. User 30: Mirrors that look like windows would be super cool, but also... what about framing a poster of some cool scenery in the middle of them..? Maybe making a window like frame for that too.  Larger rug.. and a case of fresh flowers! Haha User 31: Get a buffet and a really tall piece of art OP: Here are a few more pictures of the room! The weird urtinure on the left are from out old apartments and we're trying to get rid of it and add shelves or something like ikea vittsjö (sorry for the mess) [URL] User 32: Looks good, I would put a plant in the corner. User 33: Plants and mirrors are a good place to start. Maybe put something on the center of the table like a red bromeliad. (Something with a  bold color) OP: Those actually need a bright indirect light lol User 33: Get a fake one User 34: A Fender Bassbreaker 007 would look/sound great in there User 35: If this is a dining nook and the wall with the guitars/albums doesn't extend much further than shown here, I would maybe paint it the same teal as your chairs and leave the other wall white.  Then maybe rearrange the guitars so they're one above each other or have them further apart and make sort of a gallery out of your albums along with a larger framed poster or two of your favorite band(s) that might compliment the colors you have here?   Otherwise, agree with others: bigger rug either in neutral or more blue tones and then maybe rotate the art/mirrors or get bigger mirrors.   Nice Jeff Buckley album cover!\n",
            "User 71 - fcgrks Original Post: We just painted the orange and blue and don’t like the orange! What would look better?? Image: a kitchen with a metal sink, wooden counter, and orange cabinets. User 1: Blue OP: Like same color blue?? User 1: I think so. Having them match in that electric blue color would flow better than the contrasting color. I’d also consider a soft sky blue for each. OP: Thanks!! User 2: Do you have inspo-pics or what you’re going for? Hard to tell in the current pic given the lighting and the unfinished-ness of the room. OP: It’s a tiny home so we are trying to keep it minimal but wanted to add pops of color here. The color palette we’ve been Kinda playing around with is mainly white with pops of orange, blue and green.  Edit—if you look in my post history you can see what the space looks like before we painted the cabinets. User 3: Maybe switch out the orange for a soft lighter yellow? Alternatively, switching out the blue you have now with a darker shade of blue could help make everything less jarring. Color combination guides like [THIS ONE]([URL] may give you guys further inspo! OP: I was thinking about yellow! Thanks for your input I will check out that link. User 4: Mahogany User 5: I am not sure that either of these colours work with your counter top. If you do want to keep the blue, I would suggest pairing it with a navy blue on top or a cool red, that is on the darker side. OP: Thanks for the input! If we picked two new colors how would I find out what colors would go best with the countertop? User 5: The countertop is dark warm colour and the blue and organge are in the light and cool tone range. This is why I don't think they all work together. I think you can keep the blue if you pair it navy cabinets, especially since the bottom cabinets seem to be a little purple. Otherwise choose your blue and orange in warmer tones. OP: Thank you!!\n",
            "User 72 - fwrsaz Original Post: What to do with this?..... Image: a tv sitting on top of a tv stand in a room. User 1: Reading nook!! Or just a comfy seat :) User 2: Fish tank User 3: I think I'd place a low bookshelf there, or at least something to utilize the vertical space. I wonder what it was for originally - heating or cooling? User 4: Liquor User 5: Is there carpet on it? My initial assumption was a reading noock as well. Basically you have a built in desk or chair depending on its height. Also a good place to put like a dresser or some other thing you'd prefer not being in front of a wall. Depends entirely on your needs/preferences OP: It's just hard counter top type material. It is also an awkward height from the ground. 24\". so my feet barely touch the ground when I sit there. I thought of book shelf or dry bar, but back to awkward height but probably usable with some creativity. User 5: I'd personally put something like a bookshelf or a desk of some kind. Maybe could keep your consoles and videogames there if you're a gamer. So they're out of the way. User 2: How about a sculpture?  Are you Italian? How about a fountain? There's even an outlet there for it. User 6: Possibly a mini fridge. High enough off the ground you don’t have to bend over so far to get stuff inside. Or a popcorn maker. OP: Both maybe? Great suggestions! User 7: I, personally, would go for a beautiful shrine to the one and only Danny Devito. OP: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 you are inspirational! User 8: Plant, terrarium, bookshelf, time out corner lol User 9: Maybe get a thick piece of wood or cutting board to lay over it, you could put some sort of hanging light for decoration and a plant or sculptural piece of art.

            "User 73 - eelbb3 Original Post: Just bought my first house and need help making it feel like home. Would love any ideas especially related to paint colors. Image: a large open living room with couches and a tv. User 1: It needs softness - curtains, pillows, throw blankets, BIG area rug.  Also, plants. OP: I saw a cream rug that is 9x12. The room is 18x18 (but they are all connected)  Would that work? Or could I get away with 8x10? 8x10 has way more options.   Notes I couldn’t add it in the main post- it’s a fully naked room right now. None of that furniture is staying. User 2: 8x10 is gonna look like a postage stamp. Go bigger in a living room. User 1: Put your furniture in first, and see the layout that you like. Then get a rug large enough so you can put at least the front legs of your sofa and chairs on it. You can buy rugs online and have them delivered in a matter of days. User 3: Yep, rug is necessary User 4: I’d paint the whole space something similar to Behr’s Silver Drop—a nice, light neutral with a smidge of the same cool blue tones in the tile. I think the reason the blue in the tile stands out so much is that there are so many clashing colors in the room. Keep your walls and furniture more cool-toned and it should recede into the background. You can utilize the fireplace wall as an accent wall as the prior owners did if you like. Stick with the same color family, just a shade or two darker.   If painting the cabinets is in your budget, I think they’d look much nicer painted the same white/off-white as the trim surrounding the fireplace. Fill the space above the cabinets with potted plants or some large glassware or stoneware if you’re so inclined.   Does the large window have black blinds? Swap those out for some white faux wood blinds or roman shades if you’re fancy. Add some full-length curtains.   Replace the ceiling fan— it also clashes with the floor. Go for white or, if you’re feeling trendy, grey-toned wood.   In an open space like this, I’d also use area rugs to delineate the different “rooms.” As another poster said, you want one for the living area that’s large enough for at least the front legs of your sofa and chairs. I’d also find a coordinating (but not matching!) rug for the dining area, large enough for the table and all chairs to rest on when the chairs are pulled out for sitting. Maybe a wide runner for the kitchen, too. White or cream would be nice for the rugs, I think.   Overall, I think reducing the sort of orangey-brown colors in the room and keeping everything to more of a monochrome white/off-white/grey color scheme will be the best way to work with the tile. OP: Thank you for taking the time to leave such a detailed response! I looked up silver drop and I really love the color. Neutrals are my jam so you are 100% speaking my language.   Ceiling fan and rugs I am sure I can do fairly early. Cabinets may take some more time but I can see where you are coming from. Especially with the black counter top. Luckily they are wood so they can be redone without much issue.  Additionally, I saw a post where they painted the tiles around the opening of the fireplace. I am considering painting them the same white as the trim. Does this sound crazy or do you think it would look nice? I feel like the house has more than enough of the tile. User 4: I do think the tiles around the fireplace would look nicer if they were the same color as the trim. I’m not sure how durable it would be, but if others have done it, I’m sure they know. It sounds like this is more of an interim plan anyway, and you’ll eventually (maybe several years out) be replacing the tiles anyway, if I’m reading your post correctly. I’d say go for it!  Good luck and congratulations on the new house! Open floor plans like this can be challenging, because you want it to look cohesive but still have defined areas for different purposes. I think it’ll look great once you get it painted and styled. Make sure to keep us posted with your updates. User 5: I would LOVE to see this transformation, please update us! User 6: I literally just painted the tile in front of my fireplace! Humblebrag: it looks AMAZING (the tiles were actually already painted when I moved in, and for a variety of reasons, I didn’t want to demo).  I used this tutorial[this tutorial]([URL] with painters tape for my design instead of a stencil. You could definitely just do a flat color, though. I figured that my tiles were in a pretty low traffic area, so the paint would hold up just fine. Disclaimer... I haven’t lived with it so I could be totally wrong, lol.  DM me if you want more info or want to see the process/result pics. OP: Just got word yesterday that my husband and I are going to own this home in the next month. Right now I am very nervous and excited, when we toured it was very dark on the inside and the blue in the tile stood out aggressively. Since we will be keeping this flooring for a few more years, I would love guidance on how to paint to mellow out the floors a bit. I love cool neutral colors and a don’t fall into any one design style (just like my house or look lived in, cozy I think?)  Current furniture includes a 7ft low backed grey couch with squared strait arms. None of the furniture in the photo is staying. Dimensions of the living area are 18x18 but the floor plan is completely open with the kitchen (15x13), breakfast room (8x10) , dining room (14x11), entry way and living room (18x18) attached.   Day one plans include scrubbing the tile and grout and replacing the lightbulbs with some that are less yellow and slightly brighter. User 7: If the blue in the tile is that prominent, go very neutral on the wall colors. If you get excited about a feature wall, maybe green or a dark (navy) blue. But really, blue colors just absorb light. It sounds like it feels dim to you. I recommend a cream, toasted vanilla will feel warm and bright without looking brown. Rugs to break up the space. Then plants. So many plants. User 8: I like the teal, but maybe cover the mauve up with cream or light grey. Teal + mauve always reminds me of a hospital for some reason. User 9: I have that exact coffee table! It’s an ikea table from the late 80s/ early 90’s. Picked mine up off fb for cheap and restored it. It looks great in my minimalist themed living room. User 10: I would keep the blue.  It need art work , neutral color curtains and color on your pillows. Keep the neutral color. User 11: I will be following you update us after you make this house a home User 12: Great potential!  I'd do a light green (w. a hint of blue in a lighter shade than the kitchen. Keep the wall with the cabinets darker than the rest to visually pull it closer) Put ceiling to floor length curtains to either side of the window to frame it.  Get a huge warm rug in tones that harmonize with the floor. cabinets and sofa.  Edit: I saw you're bringing a grey couch - excellent. Put in neutral pillows and a throw to make it cozy, and a lamp for ambient lighting in that area.  I'd also put a larger piece of art above the fireplace or a series that fills the wall better in scale (think golden ratio)  Don't forget loads of flowers, put big ones on either side of the TV and on the side table.  You can even hang them to create \"areas\" for example to seperate the breakfast nook and make it a little more cozy and closer by pulling the eye closer with a plant. Directly in the eyeline from where you are standing close to the breakfast area.  Please keep us posted. OP: Thank you for responding! I am leaning towards greenery over flowers (less likely to murder it and allergies) but I agree it needs something living. I like the idea of using them as frames.   I plan to keep everyone posted and will respond after it’s painted and clean. Furniture is going to be a long road (I love thriftiness) but I will gladly share then too. User 13: Hi😃so I would repaint in a light flat light brown. All walls. Then change dining chandelier to something w wrought iron in it. Then the barstools, coffee tbe, end table all change to a black wood contemporary style. Add a beige traditional 8x10 rug and all set! User 14: Class it up with a dark gray; it's large enough and appears well-lit enough that it won't make it feel confining in my opinion.  OR maybe a light gray (maybe light blue-gray to match the tile) and then a dark, rich gray on the fireplace wall as an accent for some variation to make for a stronger focal point. User 15: Paint all the walls one color - a very light neutral taupe or very light warm grey. All the trim should be (stay) white.  Get a very large area rug - at least 9x12 - for the living room area. User 16: Rug please! User 17: It's a beautiful and spacious home, dont be afraid of adding too much.  Get some plants (varying in sizes)   The kitchen walls don't match the cabinets at all, try off white, pinkish and beige,  or even just a really light beige colour for the kitchen walls. It will make a huge difference.    The frame of the fire place doesn't match with anything, painting it a warmer colour that matches with the lighter tones of the floor tiles would do it great justice.  Also, it would be nice if  the coffee table, and the end tables match the frame of the fire place.    For the sofa, don't go for leather. If you do, ensure that it's less shiney,  and not brown.  Brown doesn't match with the walls of the living room. User 18: We are in a very similar situation, with an open floor plan that includes dated cabinets in kitchen, flooring that is good quality but doesn't suit us and a ton of other improvements to make besides the family room. For a couple weeks I checked Facebook Marketplace and a neighbor email group for good, slightly used furniture. Bought 4 good pieces for $1,000.  In talking to the furniture sellers, I found one is a furniture showroom saleswoman, one an interior designer and one a homeowner who'd done a remodel, so the furniture is quality, slightly used and an improvement. We were able to round up two custom modern maple office storage pieces with a drop down desk area, a slightly used espresso brown leather couch and a bedroom dresser in a better size and style than I currently have.   Have you established what style you want for this room - modern, farmhouse, transitional, or what style?  I'm leaning to modern for our house but it will be transitional until we have more of a budget. If you're going for modern, the fireplace surround / molding needs to be updated (replaced) the fan updated, the mauve and pink? walls changed. I can see this with modern bar stools, a big rug, keep the side table and perhaps the coffee table? And start buying good used furniture and adding pieces. I got my husband to begin appreciating what you could find - after shopping at a good furniture store & seeing those prices. Start with an established style and work towards that. Our favorite rug was found in a resort town, during a huge summertime rummage sale. $100!\n",

Image: a blue fireplace and television in a room with hardwood floors. User 1: TV looks great where it is.  Please god do not mount it on that beautiful fireplace.  Perhaps hang a picture.  Candles look good.  Maybe look into a fire curtain/screen. User 2: They would need to watch tv standing. I would hang some wooden thai relief there and add a rgb light on the back. User 3: I think a round mirror would look nice User 4: I would style it with a sledgehammer but it seems a lot of people here like it. To me it looks like a crematorium. User 5: With you 100% User 6: 1000% User 7: I'm personally not a fan of t.v's over the fireplace. Is yours a Frame TV? Do you like where it is right now? Can we see more of your space? What's your decorating goal / style overall?   My first ideas were:   1. Consider hanging the art from the beam, rather than attaching to the brick.  2. The candles in the fireplace look like teeth, ha ha. I'm sure they look better IRL, it was just my first reaction! I love the look of white logs in fireplaces that aren't operational. Or [fill-a-log look]([URL] which can be a DIY type project and would work for your fireplace.   You don't necessarily need anything at all if you're going for a minimal look. You could do a [natural wood mantel]([URL] but it depends on your overall theme.   [Here is some more inspiration]([URL] -- does anything jump out at you in particular?   If you're worried about the ceiling slant a safe idea is a round piece of art or mirror. If you're worried about the asymmetrical nature of your fireplace, I wouldn't be-- I'd just go with it and line the art up with the beam rather than the fireplace. Off kilter art could look interesting here.   When in doubt, get out some painters tape and tape up whatever art and/or mantel you are considering.   But don't be afraid to just leave it blank as is either. The eye always needs a place to rest. Or maybe you want to draw attention elsewhere, like an awesome rug or whatever (we haven't seen the whole room so difficult to say). Note in that inspiration link the gigantic chandelier and blank fireplace wall (not saying you need a honking huge crystal chandelier, just saying that you might want the fireplace simple so the eye focuses on some other statement instead). User 8: Don’t put the TV above. Paint is the answer for the fireplace. Something dark. The two walls right and left in the same shade only lighter. At least a poster size art print above the fireplace. Be bold. I would take down the two shelves above the TV. You don’t need anything there. Simple and bright rules the day. User 9: Add a wooden mantle. Though I would personally demolish it User 10: The grey paint is really bad - I would repaint first. After that maybe put some art up and some sort of tall vase or plant or other decor on the empty side.   It’s such a big thing in your room… if you’re not getting rid of it maybe look into converting it to gas or getting a nice electric insert. User 11: Big classic (gold) framed painting would be nice above the fireplace, perhaps a rug and some poofs. A basket of blankets? User 12: If you are to mount the TV on the fireplace, I would center it based on the whole width, and put something like a plant or vase on the floor beside the fireplace to compensate for it being off center.  That way, if you upgrade to a larger TV, there's no chance it will be too wide and extend past the brick on the left side.  You may also want to get a fake mantle to hide the cables too. User 13: Why is the fireplace not centered! User 14: Mount the tv User 15: in the fireplace. Yule log video FTW. User 16: I would mount the tv over the fireplace (offset), get an electric insert for it.  I would build a proper floor to ceiling shelf next to it. The whole wall seems off because of the tv cabinet. User 17: This is a good idea too! User 18: Lots of great ideas here, [[URL]  I would cover the fireplace with [slate tile]([URL] [concrete-looking tile]([URL] or, for a lighter look, a [straited marble style]([URL] (The [straight tile look]([URL] is not my personal favorite, but it is very good with your house style.) I would also make the opening flush, as the sample photos are, and/or add a gas, gel, or electric insert. (I woudl also pull off the half-round wood moulding, which looks cheap and see if you do without or add a bullnose tile in a complimentary style to what you have on the hearth.  Then, think of one wide floating shelf in a dark wood tone like walnut.  In the [last photo]([URL] I also like how they built a bookcase with doors. This might work well for you, too and you can design it to leave it open to watch TV or hide it away.  Looks like a great project—post updates!  P.S. If you like the [look of the logs in this photo]([URL] you could think about relocating the lights itch, building a cubby floor-to-ceiling, and putting decorative logs in there. It woudl be very dramatic.  UPDATE: Just found [THIS one—would be a fabulous look for you]([URL] User 19: Mount the tv! User 20: Moubt a TV over it and put a bookshelf to the side where the fireplace is uneven. You can use it for games and more, the bookshelf. User 21: You could mount it, centered on the actual hearth; and maybe put three small picture frames vertically on the right side. User 22: Move the planter next to the TV onto the floor to the right of the fireplace. I think a mantel shelf the whole length of the brick would look nice. Add some candles, plants or nicknacks. I’d add an interesting huge clock or mirror above the mantle. User 23: Using it as a mini gallery space would be cool. You could play a lot of colour off of that deep grey background.     Don't cover it up too much though, it's gorgeous! User 17: We also have a mid century modern home like you with a working but not used fireplace. We live in Florida, who needs a fireplace, it gets cold three days out of the year.   What my artist wife did was put led lights with a big Boulder with a bed of rock at the bottom and a few decorative sticks. She gets compliments on it all the time. Our TV is to the left and we have left the area above the fireplace blank like you have yours. However, in your case you would want to figure out how to properly hide the electrical wires and mount a larger TV centered and at a comfortable height for viewing.   A friend of ours with a similar home capped their fireplace inside and out and turned it into a home for their ball python. Has special lighting and terrain (branches and rocks) for the snake to hide in and climb around on.   Sketch out a few ideas and post again. User 24: I think the drab color is what's turning me off. It's A LOT of gray in your face.  A thick wood mantle of some kind would let you put up some softer or colorful peices to break it up. I like someone else's idea of a round mirror perhaps. Some birch logs arranged on a proper fireplace grate would look nice, maybe with a candle then flanking each side. User 25: You could install a ventless gas fireplace if you wanted the ambiance.    I wouldn’t go the TV route unless you have to have the space for a TV.   As mentioned above, a nice wood mantle would look good…you could do a sculptural art piece above. User 26: Well the color is bad the fireplace should've been in the middle  as far the tv goes my sister has hers above the fireplace and wall sconces on the side looks really nice. User 27: Floating shelves, photos in a nice pattern, plants, big mirror, I could continue bc there are so many options!! User 28: I would get a frame TV and hang it over the fireplace looking like a a framed painting User 29: These faux logs are what we have in our fireplace. It sits on the metal thing you put logs on. Then you inserts tea lights. We have ours on a remote. If you wanted to, you could add a screen infront. I'd also add a tall plant to the right of the fireplace.

User 2: With the pandemic these alcohol/sanitizer damage posts are on the rise. I feel really bad for people because you can’t fix it, and LV won’t replace it. User 3: I ruined a purse from colored hand sanitizer. It’s been like a year & im still annoyed. Colored hand sanitizer is super risky for purses. :( User 4: Yeah, I got a drop on one of my handles and it’s still there. I actually shed a tear or two 😩 User 2: Awe!!! Is it a leather handle? They can replace that if it is! If it continues to bother you. User 4: It’s a tiny spot, but I’ll have to look into it. User 5: This is why I keep my hand sanitizer in a make-up bag inside my bag. It's a good idea for keeping the inside of a bag cleaner and free of mess. I learned this the hard way when a lipstick tube melted inside my LV pouchette. OP: I’m screaming crying throwing up :( User 2: You could always consider sending it to an artist to have them paint a design on it…? I’ve seen people get their pet, or a cartoon, or flowers etc. just something to consider for saving it? There are a bunch on instagram that are really cool. User 6: Happened to my LV wallet. Doesn’t bother me much though but oil helps a bit. User 7: Have you been using hand sanitizer and touching it afterwards? Unfortunately it’s not going to come off as it’s damage to the canvas. User 8: Yeh no that’s not coming off sadly User 9: Oh, no. Unfortunately, that looks pretty permanent. I’d take it to a cobbler. User 10: You know there are businesses that specialize in restoring bags, I’m sure you could get it fixed User 11: I think it is the canvas coating rubbing off? If you bought directly from LV, take to boutique. User 12: Yes! Take it to the boutique, they do repairs. I lovingly stained my LV bag that was a white epi leather and they repaired it for $180AUD. A lot cheaper then I expected! User 13: Send photos to Rago Brothers they do phenomenal restoration work on all leather and canvas- New Jersey or NY I believe, gl!! User 14: Oh no crying for you 😭 this actually looks a bit like my wood flooring which got a bit stained from spraying alcohol and not wiping up immediately (white marks). You need to act fast (not let it sit for days) to try and get rid of. What I did was wet it and then wipe with a wet towel with some dish detergent. After some rubbing I was actually able to get it off the wood flooring. Obviously this is canvas and not wood and any harsh products are frowned upon but if you want to try pls do so at your discretion! 😭 maybe you can try a little bit at one of the areas and then quickly wipe dry if seeing no progress? Good luck my friend\n",

Would definitely bag if I could afford another luxury bag User 2: Ooooo looks lovely and the silhouette is pretty \"trendy\" these days, despite it being a timeless look piece as well. Love the adjustable strap! User 3: Love it! Gorgeous! Love this color too! 🥰 User 4: I adore the hardware and the rounded shape. It looks like it might be a little too shallow for my tastes but the perfect half-moon, hobo style silhouette is gorgeous. User 5: Love the shape and the color of the bag, would get it if I could! User 6: Love the shape of the bag User 7: Thanks, now I have to obsess over this. User 8: Gorgeous. They have a bucket bag I covet!!! User 9: I love this bag. It’s special because it’s trendy, but also simple enough to be relatively trend-proof. User 10: 10/10 gorgeous you have to buy it (I don’t have it but I rly want this for you) User 11: It is gorgous. IMHO.  I don't have a Celine budget but if I did I would buy in a heartbeat. User 12: This is super pretty. I love the shape and color of it. User 13: I have this bag and I love it! I reach for it the most out of all my bags currently and it’s a great piece. It was my first celine bag and I loved it so much I ended up ordering the belt bag in light taupe after but never carry it because the Ava is my go to.

I'm trying to figure out how to add a little color to it all. The kitchen does have an orange backsplash. Image: a room that has lots of windows in it. User 1: Plants, with all those windows. User 2: That’s a nice apartment you have there. I would add orange, and a secondary color like yellow or green to pillows, vases, art work, and a blanket. OP: Any ideas on a rug color? Originally I was going to get a tan leather sofa and had all my ideas based around that, then I decided to save a little money and just go with a fabric sofa. I was thinking about getting an orange/terracota colored throw for the sofa. Then natural oak or terracota bases for some plants.    Is there a way to add multiple photos to the original post? It would only let me add one picture. User 3: Since you don't have a lot of wall space for art, I'd suggest getting a patterned rug - something like a kilim rug with terracotta as one of the colours in it would give you visual interest, pattern and colour.   That's a great apartment, by the way! OP: Unique Loom Autumn Collection Checkered Abstract Casual Warm Toned Area Rug, 5 x 8 ft, Multi/Dark Brown [URL]  I was considering this rug. It's a little on the cheap side but I still think it looks nice.   And I did buy some burnt orange pillows for the sofa with a beige throw User 4: I would go for something with more organic shapes since everything else in the apartment is already pretty boxy. You'll notice that interior designers for industrial lofts use a lot of oriental or southwestern rugs to warm up what can otherwise be pretty visually cold spaces  Maybe something like this? [URL] User 5: I think the colors of the rug are nice, but the pattern might be a little too choppy and too many squares. I think something more like this would look nice: [URL] User 6: I have a tan (leather) sofa and burnt orange throw pillows, but a rich blue rug really sets it off. Or the rug you chose with blue velvet pillows or a throw.  Blue and dark orange really play well with each other. User 7: I'm in love with this. I agree, lean into the orange and add warm colours and plants and floral prints if you like them. OP: Here are some additional photos as well to give an idea of the rest of the main area. Also, would you guys suggest putting the tv against the only drywall area as long as it fits with the barndoor? Originally I wanted to put it in front of the window, but now that they took the plastic off the windows and I get this clocktower view, I'm not sure I want to block that.  [URL]  [URL]  [URL] User 8: Yes, I believe the TV stand needs to go where the barn door is (maybe pulled out 6” so as not to get hit - too bad it’s not a regular swinging door). If the tv goes anywhere else, it could get wet. OP: The clearance from the wall to the edge of the opened door is actually about 70 inches. So I can still fit something there and it not get hit, as for the tv getting wet, honestly I just planned to never open those two windows. User 9: Art work, pillows, and an area rug would bring in some color.  Here are a few area rug suggestions:  1.) [URL]  2.) [URL]  3.) [URL]  4.) [URL]  5.) [URL] User 10: I have nothing to add, just here to say your soon to be apartment looks dope af. Congrats + enjoy. User 11: I was going to suggest oranges!

User 1: The torn and bloody banners of your defeated enemies alongside their bleached skulls, tastefully transformed into decorative goblets. User 2: I'm obviously late here, but glad I made it in time to upvote this comment. User 3: Lean various sizes of black and white framed art User 4: One large picture with a bright color scheme. Then get an area rug with a similar color in it for the ground. It’ll liven things up a bit. OP: I was thinking of commissioning my sister to make a 3 piece canvas User 4: That would work. I’d probably try to find a rug with a color you like in it, then try to get her to use that color in the painting. It might be difficult to match a rug to a custom painting if you do the painting first. User 5: can i interest you in a financially crippling Funko POP collection ? User 5: One mega sound-bar :D User 6: what media stand is that ? OP: I forget specifically the name of it, but I bought it from Wayfair User 7: How do you like the quality? Is it particular board similar to ikea? Is it shiny or matte?   Thanks! OP: Quality I would say is a little better than IKEA - it is glossy on the outside. I know in looking at reviews, multiple people had issues with damaged parts. Mine did have damage too, but thankfully it was internal where you can't tell User 8: Real plants or fake? OP: Only the big palm is real User 9: The best thing to add in that area would be your collections, you can add your books, action figures, small photo frames by the way on the side you might be interested in adding some multi-panel on the side like this [one]([URL] or a three panel like [here]([URL]  By the way you've got a good choice of lamp. User 10: Id say books and random cool stuff like smaller succulents and vinyl toys. Random decor.  Larger art would be distracting imo right above the TV. User 11: Vinyl toys are tacky as hell. Steer clear, OP. User 10: If you have tacky tastes, you'd buy tacky vinyl toys. Lol. User 5: I think I’d put four or five wooden giraffes of various sizes 🦒 on the shelf. User 12: Some books and random art pieces User 13: Another TV /s User 14: Is this pic taken from where you sit when watching tv? OP: [URL] not quite User 15: So I agree with most others that a large piece of art with color that matches a carpet would probably be best.  I am however a little perplexed by your current setup. Is the chair blocking a doorway? Is there enough space to get around the chair and end table? It's probably just the angle of the photo but this makes them look like they are completely in the way. If they are, then moving the chair closer to the corner and rotating it towards the couch might be the better spot for it.  Also, if this were my space, I would re-align the tv/shelf to be centred with the V of the ceiling. Right now the symmetry of the room seems off. It would also make watching tv from the couch a lot more enjoyable since it would align better to it. Obviously, if you did this than you would flip the plant to the other side. User 16: I see you haven't paid the cat tax. User 17: Your bong collection! User 18: Question: do those plants get enough light? My living room is similar to yours and is pretty dark so all the plants I put back there eventually need to be moved into a more sunny location OP: The large majesty palm is the only real plant. I have only had it for about a week, so I haven't had much time to gauge that yet User 19: Vinyl Records mix and matched User 20: What type of plant is the big one? And where did you get it. Love it. OP: Majesty palm from Lowes User 21: Pictures, little knock knacks and plants! User 22: What color paint is that? OP: Repose gray by Sherwin Williams User 23: Childhood sports trophies OP: How could I forget! User 24: something with color ffs...  and for the height of the room the tv is too low. User 25: I know this doesn't answer the question you asked, but I think you should consider raising the TV up. From your other picture posted it looks like the TV is really low in relation to the couch. I would raise it up so the middle of the TV is at or around eye level, then reposition the shelf to match. That change alone will dictate what you put on it because of the height restriction. OP: I have a low-sitting IKEA karlstad which is actually pretty level with the TV, otherwise yeah I definitely would raise the TV if it wasn't level\n",

Image: a kitchen with a large tiled floor and black appliances. User 1: Why not extend the hardwood floor into the kitchen? I think that would look lovely. OP: That was my first choice as well but when we got it quoted it didn’t fit our budget 😢 User 2: Is it something you can save for? And just get a nice big rug for now?   Otherwise I’d go dark and dramatic. Dark dark gray or black - and it could handle a fun pattern. Long tiles in an ashlar pattern or even a slate herringbone situation (pattern running perpendicular to hardwoods). User 1: Maybe you could get a wood laminate that has a design like this do it doesn't look out of place with the rest if the floor.  [URL] User 3: A green or blue slate tile would bring a nice deep, earth toned color that the space desperately needs. User 4: I think a long dark colored tile or vinyl laminate like charcoal would look awesome here. I think a light color would make the space look too sterile User 5: I think a taupe colour would tie it all in. The warm wood and grey from the cabinets. I like a neutral base that you can accentuate with colourful touches if you like, than can be easily moved. For a flooring I think something like the ivory colour of this tile would suit: [URL] User 6: I think you need color or drama. The white on white on white look is dying. Play with adding some color with some decorative tiling. Or drama with darker tile/lvp like a gray or even black. User 7: A nice clean, slate gray colored tile would look good! OP: That’s what we went with!! And I loooooove it!\n",

User 1: Start adding decorations that are copper colored and more greens that are your bed cover or pair well with it. OP: Love this idea, thank you! User 1: Mabey stick with a theme too? Your bed is fern-sy/woodsy? So decor that leans that way with coordinating colors? If you can paint or wall paper take one wall, find a light background and mimic or resemble the blanket pattern? I'm sure there's some string lights out there that are set far enough apart/with thin enough wire to look like fireflys on said mural/wall paper? Spit balling here OP: I was thinking of finding a darker rug, adding decals to the closet doors and adding art to the wall but not sure about how to keep it from being too much with the wall colour being white and the dark floors User 2: Mirrors and framed art! User 3: Yes...and plants. User 4: Your bedding and that picture are really gorgeous 😍😍 please put it up it'll look glorious.  I'm thinking natural/brown sheepskin rug to go with that green velvet bedspread, and maybe some faux ivy over the  curtains & curtain rail  The white is a good base but it's quite a cold sterile white - there are softer gentler shades you could look into.  I'd also replace the white bedside cabinet with something wooden and maybe rattan as well for texture. OP: Good ideas and thank you for this, I love the idea of the natural rug! I agree with you about the white too User 5: Add a plant! I have added plants to my room and they have added so much life. User 6: Definitely add golden yellow and mauvelous pink furniture or decorations to contrast the green bed-set. OP: Oooh great call on the mauve, I love that contrast! Thank you! User 7: I would add more deep green/emerald paintings or tints of copper or deep purple decor. Maybe some plants and more greenery if thats the theme you want to stick to. OP: Thank you!! User 8: I love the green 🌿 OP: Thank you! ❤️ User 8: A mirror on your closet would reflect the light and help the room feel bigger. You can also paint the backwall with an accent color and that will make it appear longer. OP: Thanks! I agree, the closet is a bit tricky to put actual mirroring onto, but adding some illusion of depth there I think could be lovely… appreciate your ideas here, thanks!!

User 1: I think wall hangings that feature rich textures and handwoven techniques also go well with the black-and-white style of your room. User 2: You can put [colorful tree painting]([URL] (4 panels) or one of these [green leaves or quotes paintings]([URL]   ***Good luck!!*** User 3: This person is clearly a shill for that website based on their post history. Neither of their recommendations match your space.    You could do a large photo ledge (if you can find a few studs in the wall to mount it to so that it's secure) [which is neat because you can easily swap out the art/photos as you feel.]([URL])    [A big round silver mirror would also look nice!]([URL])      I know you didn't ask this - but swapping the navy sheets for some nice crisp white bed linen would help tie your space together.You can keep the colour in the throw pillows if you like it as an accent colour, or get a navy duvet (see photo above for grey/navy bed) but it's too dark for a full sheet set. I would also consider swapping the navy sheer curtains for something lighter in colour. OP: BTW I somehow missed that photo ledge, which I actually really love the idea of. I’m going to look into building! And PS I also hated those first suggestions hahaha. Thank you for confirming that. OP: They are actually black and I now have a black comforter as well. The sheer curtains are also black. I love super modern and I love the black and white contrast. I actually modeled my room exactly after a modern room that I really liked with black accents. But, you make good points! I will try white sometime and see how I like it! Thank you! User 4: I'd do black and white photography. OP: oooh i like that idea, maybe a few big prints User 4: Yes you could do two 8x10's mounted in big white mats with thin black frames. User 3: Ah I see! Interesting how different colours can look on computer monitors. Maybe try a white blanket instead of grey to provide more contrast with the black sheets? It just seems a bit unbalanced currently. OP: I like that idea!! i’ll try it! or maybe white sheets since i currently use a black comforter now.\n",

User 1: You just need to fill in the bottom with rectangular planters  [URL] User 2: With climbing plants would be cool (once you add those planter boxes)! User 1: Very nice! OP: Actually this may he a good idea thanks User 1: You're welcome, it's not a failed wall it's just a half wall seeking a bottom :P User 3: This is a great idea! Visual interest beyond the wood, plus plants! OP: My issue is this design fell twice, I need an alternative User 1: Oh, then planters affixed to it would probably help a lot.  Wind will blow many things over unless they are weighted. OP: I didnt even realize that, thanks User 1: You're welcome User 4: I would also space the slats out a litter further. They won’t be as opaque, but they’d let the wind through more. User 5: 😂 User 6: I love this!!!! User 1: Yay! User 7: It’s not failed .., continue the same strips to the bottom and clean up the sides … run a saw up and zip the irregular edges off . I think it looks cool … if you want to spice it up more get some vines planted on the ground and run them up the wall User 8: The FAIL is that it fell over 2x according to OP.  The planter idea everyone gave is a great idea and would look beautiful.  For the time being until you can get something going, you might try to anchor it into that grass behind, or add 2 diagonal supports to the back.  It wouldn't be eye pleasing but would support the structure until you can give it some bottom weight with planters or some other support.  If you own the property you could also anchor it into the patio with metal post anchors. OP: The patio is pebble aggregate,is it easy to anchor to? I'm a bit scared of doing it User 8: Hmm, that one I'm not sure on. You could pound a wooden stake into the ground and bolt it to that. It might not work long term but until you can figure something else out it would probably stabilize as I'm not sure about the pebble aggregate.  You could also just remove the stabilizers you currently have and actually sink the posts into the ground with cement. It would then not even be on the actual porch but just beside it. User 9: Planters and put in vines that you can train up the wall a bit. Makes it so pretty. User 10: Put some sand bags on the feet. Four on each leg, 50lbs each should work. User 11: If you affix large planters at the bottom put a cement block in each to keep it stable then add your dirt. User 12: I actually think it's really pretty, even if its not conventional or whatevs seemingly wrong w it:P. I was gonna say pots or planters w climbing vine plants to go on the walls. Everyone's thinking the same thing lol OP: Thanks, the stability of this thing is questionable, fallen twice now, im.going to do the planter in front idea User 13: Can you dig a hole for each post and fill it with QuickCrete? OP: That was an idea but the area behind it is turf and I don't want to dig a hole in the turf User 7: The have these sheets of rolled “privacy screen” that attach onto fences. You could throw it on an call it a day.    Inexpensive fix. Amazon has a lot of selections. I had one before that looked like ivy. They’ve got bamboo and all kind of colors User 14: Put some vines on that wall User 6: I actually love this a lot, especially with the suggestion of some planters to block out the bottom. What did you do to make this/did you have anything online you found so I could replicate this summer? OP: Thanks, I'll redo it in a better way. I used this video   [URL] User 15: Use the rectangle planters and maybe paint this. A dark green will blend with your surroundings. User 16: I say add a rose bush or a vine bush that drapes down. Unsure on if there's a better term/word for it but they sit/grow on a thin wooden board or a metal board and it does create privacy but also beauty. OP: Thanks I'm trying to grow stuff but It has to be grown in pots User 17: If you want to keep it from falling maybe stick the vertical wood in two planters with concrete inside? If you really wanted to be sure you could then bury it User 18: Would bamboo pots in front of it do? I heard they are great for cover walls. 3 jumbo pots- buy them tall (matured ?) from nursery.  Good luck op User 19: Morning glories and moon flowers planted together. [URL] User 20: Vertical herb garden would look nice on it User 21: let some ivy grow there and add a red wooden decoration object a little off the side from the middle\n",
            "User 83 - ifoqxl Original Post: help me pick an accent wall color plz Image: a living room with a tv and a bunch of furniture. User 1: There's already a LOT of color here. I wouldn't bother with an accent wall. User 2: I wouldn't do an accent wall. If you aren't happy with the amount of color, I would probably just paint the entire room in a subtle color (something that won't pull away from the boldness of the color that's already there, but won't be so..... white) User 3: A subtle yellow/gold would be nice. User 4: On the wall with the windows in. Or red! The red from the painting! User 5: It looks like you have space above the couch for a large art piece? Is go that way. I LOVE color and you have so many nice, rich colors in this room. I think you’re going to lose the depth of them if you paint the walls a color. The White helps them pop and feel saturated. I would keep the walls white! OP: this is exactly why i was having such a hard time! thank you User 5: I guess if you really want a wall color, don’t do it solid! Get a stencil with a pattern that will leave the majority or the wall white but the stencil design will be color. That could be cool and keep it from flooding the room. It would have to be a simple design so it doesn’t  over complicate the room! User 6: Which wall are you going to paint? User 7: If you insist on it - The windowed wall in the same gold as the sofa. User 8: I’d say the window wall in a very soft pink. User 9: I am usually all for bright colors and accent walls and normally white walls bore me intensely but.... this looks really great exactly how it is. User 10: This looks great, not sure an accent wall would improve it. That said, you could do that gold/mustard on the wall with the windows. User 11: I don't think mustard would look good with the amber light wood floors. Kinda like when I try to wear dark yellow clothing, it's a weird peach & mustard hell. Someone suggested a jewel tone red, I think that might be better. I also like the purple in the lower right corner of the painting. User 10: I like the purple idea OP: i originally thought to do a deep purple User 12: I third a nice dark deep purple, goes well with the rest of the jewel tones present in the room already User 13: If it wasn't for your baseboards and the AC unit, I would paint all the walls teal like the chair and curtains.   Also I'd move the teal art above the sofa, and double-triple- up your curtains to make them a lot fuller, extending the rods so the curtains stack back on the wall not the window. I'd do this regardless of what color you paint the walls. User 14: What about instead of an accent wall you did a simple but large shape? Like a big yellow circle or a triangle - but off center and geometric so it looks intentional but funky? OP: i like this idea! User 14: My friend’s been doing it to [her house. ]([URL] I’m not bold enough to do it in mine, but I think it looks cool. OP: oh that’s fantastic! User 15: That looks awesome! User 15: Yessss do this! Behind the TV that corner, a big mustard/deep yellow circle going over both walls would look amazing User 9: Yeah this is good! User 16: Yess do this!  I am picturing violet, though.  Like a bright, balanced purple.  Might be a little off beat but honestly that seems like your style. OP: purple was my first mind! User 17: I think I would do a deep purple on the window wall. Maybe do a big triangle from the bottom corners of the room and have the point at the top of the room in between the windows? That would look really neat! User 18: Do a nice dark green or greenish blue. User 19: I agree with u/keiwei66 about the pink, something like [Farrow and Ball Cinder Rose]([URL] I think with such a neutral kind of pink you could probably do either of the longer walls this colour User 20: I second the person who said pink, but I’d go soft coral. Love your sofa. User 21: I would do a wine/blood red! If you have this much color going on, lean in to it and go for all the jewel tones! User 22: I think you have enough color and it looks nice as it User 23: Maybe a patterned wall on the wall the gold couch is on. I could see a nice pastel brown/yellow/gold working there. With maybe some geometric lines. User 24: Paint at least the window wall bright white— the eggshell isn’t letting those colors pop as much as they can. User 25: Use the same color family as the chair and curtains.  From the photo, I can't tell if they are green or teal.  You could do couch pillows in a similar shade of chair or curtains, and/or a lighter shade as an accent wall.  Whatever you pick, I recommend you get a sample and paint some to confirm.  Colors always seem lighter or darker than the paint chip. User 26: I think all the walls could use color, and that the window wall should be a different color than the others, but NOT any deep tones the way a typical accent wall would be, unless you plan on changing the curtains to something lighter.   I wonder how it would look with the window wall in a waaay desaturated gold like [BM Hay Stack]([URL] and the others with a way desaturated teal like BM [San Celemente Teal]([URL]  I do like the idea of adding texture/pattern to the walls rather than just color if that sparks your interest at all. User 27: I would choose the window wall and do three shades of coral/orange in a bold, large scale geometric shape. Use painters tape to make a white line in between the three colors: [URL] OP: ooooohhh that’s nice! User 28: Really nice! :D User 29: I don't think you need an accent wall. You've put a lot of vibrant, complimentary colors in the room already. User 18: The color of the chair and curtains! I think that would look really pretty. User 30: White is a classic. User 31: I love your sofa! Could you please share where you got it? OP: thank you! i got it from floydhome.com User 31: Thank you! I'd never heard of this company before. User 32: Wow, your decor is about the same colors as mine, lol. I have that same chair in yellow and my couch is blue with red flowers. Even the curtains are that color, but velvet. I also have an outstanding color painting that was used as an inspiration for various colors. Coffee table is red leather, large blue oriental rug.    My walls are an olive green and looks great with it all:  [[URL] OP: nice! my curtains are velvet too! lol thank you, i like that color User 33: If anything I'd go [grey]([URL] and try to make it more [cohesive]([URL] User 34: You could do slate grey if you wanted but I honestly like it white User 35: I would do a light grey on the wall where the desk is. If you go too dark, it will make the room feel small.\n",

And you have enough room that you can keep the loveseat if you think it’s comfy.   The type of sofa depends on your budget and your style - I love the vintage look you’ve got going on already, and a thrifted coffee table would do nicely, but I wouldn’t suggest a secondhand sofa. The good news is you’ve got some room so you can get almost anything that takes your fancy! Personally I think a three seater will give you more long-term flexibility than a sectional, but I guess sectionals are popular for a reason.   Have you considered painting the two wood sidetables that are up against the far wall? I think they could look pretty great painted in two colours with the trim picked out - maybe take a couple of colours from the posters on your wall, like two different shades of orange or yellow, and use one for the body and one for the trim. It’s a pretty bold move, though, so your mileage may vary on that one!   It’s a great space for a first home - have fun with it! OP: Thanks for the advice! As far as budget, within reason I’m pretty flexible. The loveseat is just a bit awkward, as it really only seats one when it comes to having friends over… it’s a little too close for comfort for anything other than a couple, but it takes up a lot of space.   Ideally I’d love to have a nice leather chair in front of the record player, but to have it spaced out with enough seating for other people I’m not sure that would work ☹️ User 1: Ah well in that case I would get rid of the love seat as soon as you can. A leather chair by the record player would look great! And there would be plenty of room if you replace the loveseat with a normal (not oversized) sofa.   You could get some Kraft paper, have a look on the IKEA website, and map out what space the furniture would take up in your room before buying. (You don’t have to buy IKEA, but that would at least give you typical furniture sizes so you can map things out before browsing.) User 2: I've purchased a 'used sofa' from Habitat for Humanity Restore that was and is a great piece in our home.  We have the matching chair, as well. Both pieces are comfy and look great.  Got them for around $300 CAD (or under $240 UDS.) We keeping popping back there, looking for another chair that will work with our 'set'. User 3: If you're a gamer, keep the loveseat as a lounger just so your lovers can join when inspired. Let me know how it goes, I'd love that as a gamer partner. OP: I’d love any advice on how to best layout the large wall of my living room, too. My guitar and stool are just kind of there, temporarily. Anything can be moved or repositioned.  I’m 22 and this is my first house. I’m a bit overwhelmed trying to decorate an entire house myself, if I’m being honest. User 4: I think you have too many small things on one wall. It makes it look cluttered. I would buy a longer tv stand and center it on that wall. I like the guitar. I would hang it on the wall to the right of the tv stand. I would see if the other piece with the record player would fit under the window. Put your records next to it. I would take the stool out of the room. Put a big plant on the left of the tv stand. Buy a couch and put it across from the tv stand. You can see if there’s room for a small chair to the left of the couch kinda angled User 5: Btw, super cool to have your first home at 22! Bravo! User 6: I googled “rock and roll living room” and found lots of cool ideas for you. Also looking up “rock and roll vintage decor” Find your style, use what you’ve got. Hang your guitar on the Wall. Get a cool floor light, consider painting the walls dark (but not black!) User 6: Display your records on the wall for instant art  [URL] User 5: If you don’t want to spend any money this is what you do; push the sofa back and toward the centre of the carpet and so it’s almost at the edge of the carpet; put the tv on top of the other cabinet and centre it in front of the repositioned sofa; now move the freed up cabinet under the window with the sound system on it and centre it; move the table on the side of the sofa to the other side of the sofa; put the stool in the corner with the guitar and amp so it’s in a triangle formation with the stool being in the corner and the others on either side; keep the magazine rack on the side of the new tv cabinet in a similar location to where it currently is, but do not push it up against the cabinet as much as it currently is. I think that’s all User 7: Prioritize getting a chair or 2 or a larger sofa, depending on how much you like to entertain. A coffee table or end table is also always helpful for setting down a drink, or placing an extra lamp.  Next can I make a suggestion? You should put the turn table under the window, by a longer console for the tv and create a gallery wally around the tv using your current art plus adding more pieces. Everything on the wall looks like its floating. Your tv sticks out, and it looks almost too big for the table it's sitting on.  I would also mount the guitar on the wall with a hook or something so you can take it down to use it. OP: Hey, thanks for the advice.   I do see where you’re coming from on the record player, but for a few reasons I can’t make that work…  I do agree I need to prioritize furniture. I’ve been having a really hard time figuring out what is best for the space User 5: Are the reasons sun damage or electrical port? OP: Well, having my setup near the window is one reason. Wouldn’t feel great about that haha.  but mostly, I love how it turned out with my original Thin Lizzy poster / now playing record stand. I’d like to keep that intact even if everything else gets swapped out. Every time I walk into my house I think it looks awesome.  I bought a new black leather couch today so hopefully that’ll be a nice addition User 8: Put that tv on the wall as well! User 9: I like the idea of going with the rock and roll/ vintage theme. Seems like you have a lot of red, black and purple so it might be nice if you got a big cozy red or black couch to fit the colors and full up the space in the middle. Also nice colorful led lighting also helps give a room more personality and color and would help with that old school rock and roll theme. They have some good ones online. Also getting a coffee or end table for snacks or a drink would be convenient and help fill it up. But I bet you could find some good stuff to fit your theme at some thrift or antique stores. User 10: sectional User 11: A L shaped sectional and some end tables. Your space seems long.\n",

Throw up some framed pictures, maybe your diploma(s).  There’s simple and then there’s a jail cell. Art will add some much needed color.

User 1: I think slate tiles would look really nice here. Darker floors will help ground the space nicely. OP: I'm hoping so.. not a big fan of light floor or floor matching cabinetry. Thank you!! User 2: I have the light maple cabinets with dark flooring and I do not like it. As maple ages, it tends to get more yellow. I will probably be painting my cabinets light gray or white because I think they clash with the flooring. Whatever you do, don't be afraid to obtain samples that are large enough so you can really see how it will look together. OP: Very good to know, will definitely do that. Thank you!! User 3: A charcoal would go well - it’s match the oven glass User 4: I say this too.  I have this, but I have charcoal worktops so maybe it matches better.  I agree it would go with the oven though. OP: I was thinking charcoal, I was planning to carry through the living room (it's all open) and I have charcoal in there now which I love. Thank you! User 5: I think the existing flooring works well in here. I like your countertop, it's pretty!  I find it hard to believe that's a counter depth fridge: it juts out farther than the counter. What's on the other side of the kitchen? One option is to open up the wall there so you can bump the fridge back into the space behind, like if that area was a closet or something. OP: Thank you! :) unfortunately it's really junky so it has to go. It is definitely a counter depth fridge, just an extra small kitchen - it's a townhouse though and the other side is my neighbors house so can't really do anything with it :/ User 6: I'm actually in favor of the light floor color here, because you pointed out that your kitchen is small, so I don't think it needs more contrast. The flooring you have is very unobtrusive.  I'd make an exception for a slate tile that blends beiges and gray tones, though. OP: Very good point, thank you!! User 7: I think a color on the floor would brighten the room. Maybe a pale blue tile.  His is a normal sized fridge, I have one similar. My old fridge was larger and had 2 doors with a large pull out freezer. Miss it! Sold it with the house. User 8: You say clash, I say contrast. Go for dark walnut OP: Yay!! User 9: Clashing aside, I have kitchen floors in a “Espresso” color, it’s a nightmare to keep clean. I’d stay with what you have or similar to what you have. User 10: I really love your cabinets.  Do you know where they’re from?  I think the suggestions about slate or charcoal are good.  I have porcelain tile in my kitchen, with a kind of marble pattern.  The colors are shades of grey, but there’s an ocher vein that goes through it that would be picked up by those cabinets. User 11: dark floors are hell to keep clean, especially in a kitchen User 12: Your cabinets are nice but don’t pop at all. What if you did black hardware to match a darker floor  [URL] User 13: agreed that black, modern hardware will help a ton here.   I vote keep the floors light or medium brown. and if you can spring for a white countertop to really freshen up the place.   search \"light cabinets kitchen\" on Pinterest. I'm feeling too lazy to link a pic haha. User 14: Actually contrasting dark and light is popular. I think a great tone or slate would be ok User 15: I would consider getting a nice rug from Ruggable[ruggable]([URL] They can be washed in the washer so great for kitchens. I am so so happy with mine. I wasn’t ready to do big work on my kitchen but was sick of the blah floor. It’s a great option. OP: Ahh thank you for the tip!! Was considering getting one for the living room since I don't see my current white rug holding up forever lol. Glad to hear you're happy with yours! User 16: This is the advice they need most, good job.  I could not place the answer User 17: You didn't ask, but that fridge is in the wrong place. You should move that monstrosity to the edge of the room where the dishwasher currently resides. OP: If y'all don't stop picking on my fridge.. 😂😂 User 18: Man, that fridge needs to be moved and the kitchen reconfigured. OP: 😐 User 12: 😂 User 19: Gray wooden flooring. User 20: I’d go darker, just choose a color of your liking…   Maroon or a darker turquoise is the route I’d try 😊 nice kitchen! User 21: That fridge is gigantic.  What do You Have in there lol User 22: Deep gray would look great there.  Just pick a dark one with a similar undertone to the stainless steel. User 23: It is the countertop that you should worry about. The cabinets will be fine. My cabinets are antique white, and my floors are charcoal. I get away with this because my countertop has dark veins running through it. Ties it all together. User 24: The cabinets need an update. A coat of paint and new hardware. The floors can be any color you like! User 25: Keep the floor, paint the cabinets User 26: Not sure about the floor, but i think softer overhead lighting would look nice and help with the overall tone in the room!! User 27: Weird suggestion here, but white appliances instead of floor change? I know they are technically passé right now but the cool stainless and warm cabinets are saying two different things. Otherwise I'd say a warm toned wood or laminate floor. User 16: Can we…can we paint the cabinets?  I love you but they’re so boring.\n",

            "User 88 - axbesx Original Post: My biggest concern is what would I place in the area's between the fireplace and the wall. Image: empty room with two windows, one fireplace, and two ceiling fans. OP: My initial thought was putting in bookcases. But the area is too large. Its much bigger in person.  User 1: I really like the book case idea and some friends built some a few years back but kept them lower and they looked great. I'd suggest looking around to see if anywhere fits your measurements to either buy prefab or consider building them yourself (or hiring a professional). Good luck! OP: Built in book cases may work. My wife wants doors on the bottom (we have young kids who love to tear things apart lol) But i think a custom built in would look nice. User 2: If you have young kids then built-in's with cabinets would be ideal as you could use them for toy storage. When they are older it could hold homework supplies and back packs. User 3: Try guilt in bookcases that are only 2 shelves high and include a bench top with a cushion. Extra seating for guests while filling the space in a pretty way. The windows are nice and tall, too.  OP: Oh this would open up some opportunities. I wouldnt have thought if either. Another good idea to run by the wife User 4: Yeah, built-ins for sure. You can do cabinets underneath with drawers or bins the kids can put their toys in on one side, use the other for A/V equipment running through the wall to the TV.  Above the cabinets you can do bench seating (if they’re low enough) or a couple of shelves to the height of the fireplace, and run one long mantle all the way across. I think white painted built ins with a stained wooden mantle, but it’s up to you! User 5: I would stick with custom built bookcases that *aren't* built in so you can move them later if you need the space for something else. We had built-ins installed and 6 months later we realized we didn't have a good place to put our Christmas tree User 6: book case but with some green? Or something that fills the wall but is a background. I liked the bistro idea of someone too User 7: I can see that. Bookshelves could really take over the room. I'd look for a pretty sideboard (or even dresser) that fits just right, and get two. Maybe put nice lamps on both. Then if it feels like too much space up above, you could add a floating shelf or two for plants or objets d'art, etc. Just gotta be careful not to let it get cluttered. User 8: What about matching wing chairs? It could frame in your sitting area around the tv. I'd keep them co-ordinated but not perfectly matching. [Here's an example]([URL] OP: I like this idea and never would have thought of that. I also like the plants and lights. Thank you for that insight, im gonna start looking at some chairs that may match our living room set. User 9: Yes, this idea! Perfect for some cozy chairs around the fireplace :-)  User 1: 2 50 inch TVS.  User 10: Listen to this person. Priorities.  User 11: Instead of putting book cases, I think putting wall to wall floating shelves would look more modern and would add some character to the space.  You can also add some pullout baskets underneath, or some cube Kaplan shelves from ikea with door or drawer inserts.  OP: So i took measurements and on both sides of the fireplace is 5'5\" inches and the fireplace is about 56 inches. So its a 65/56/65 split. Thank you all for your suggestions! We're probably gonna go with either the wingchairs or maybe a built in bench with a cabinet underneath and bookshelf on the side (depending on cost). User 12: That’s the perfect size for two 5’ reef tanks. Lol OP: I cant let my wife see this post or this us what she'll want to do! Lol. All i can imagine is cleaning two giant fish tanks lol User 12: His and hers tanks. No problem. Lol User 13: Can you make the windows bigger?  What is on the other side?  Nice view?? OP: Sadly no. The other side if that in particular would be my privacy fence lol. Otherwise this would be a great idea! User 14: Bigass speakers.  User 15: My man! User 1: I would put in a little bistro set on one side. Tea nook. The TV on the other side, leave some empty space along the nook side, and cozy up the TV side with a sofa and love seat or a sectional. User 16: The fan isn't central 😱 OP: Lol i was drawing some ideas up on the picture and i saw that too. It gave me Forrest Whitaker eye. Now i want to go back and measure the distance to both walls in the off chance that they were standing a little to the left when the pic was taken lol User 17: Looking at the shadows you definitely were a little to the left but I'm guessing the fan is still a a little off center, but who knows perspectives are weird. User 18: My parents have a set up like that! They put matching bookcases in the spaces then filled the shelves with decorative baskets (holding cat toys and hiding WiFi routers) and figurines. I’d probably add plants and books.  User 19: Built ins for sure. User 20: Giant speakers  User 21: Matching console tables with maybe some lamps and pretty plants/flowers? User 22: Curio shelves. Book shelves. Video game collection. Large plants with large wicker basket of fluffy through blankets. Your RC car collection.  User 23: Floating bookshelves under the window. Entire length of the wall, two to three rows, then 2 tower speakers/bookshelves on a stand. Amplifier on each far side of the wall powering the system.   Something like this for the speakers [Except have the amps off the floor.]([URL]) User 24: We have almost exactly the same set up and went with a bookshelf on each side. Gives the room a cozy study-like feel.  User 1: I’d do large bookshelves on both sides  User 25: Aquariums, terrariums, lit up plants (plant boxes). Anything that will require its own lights User 26: Subwoofers and floor standing so speakers. User 27: Floor plants? Maybe only on one side  User 28: If I didn't know any better this looks like the filming studio of Brad Hall the sneaker DON\n",

Image: a girl wearing an orange and white stripe sweater with ripped jeans and black boots. User 1: I love wide leg pants! I feel like they work better on me when I wear a solid colored pointed toe shoe because it kinda continues to lead the eye down and out. Bonus points if you match the color with the pants (black), the leg never ends! OP: Thanks! I gotta find a good pair of black wide leg pants User 2: I agree with the previous two comments, floor-skimming wide-leg pants are more flattering than cropped wide-leg pants. I have a couple and like you have a really hard time balancing the volume from the leg. It is especially challenging in colder months because in summer you can just pair them with a thin-strapped top. My best advice would be to pair them with a long sleeve bodysuit and if you need an additional layer, make sure it is cropped. OP: Ok thanks! I’ll try that, I’ve definitely been struggling with what to pair them with in the past couple of months User 3: I think this looks good! I’m 5ft too and when i wear wide leg trousers i wear them a little longer so they touch the top of my foot to make the lines longer! OP: Thank you! User 4: I personally avoid wearing anything chunky or oversized with wide-leg pants, because it can make me look like I’m wearing a larger person’s outfit. Streamlined, fitted, and delicate pieces usually make me feel more comfortable when I wear something oversized like wide leg pants, so that the pants look like an international statement piece rather than just being too big. OP: Thanks! That makes sense, I’ll give it a shot! User 5: I don’t think you look that short in the pic, I actually think the outfit suits you really well and looks very well proportioned.  I only have one pair of wide leg pants and they’re of a thinner material and lilac, so I don’t think they go well with clunky shoes (wore them with a winter boot doc marten and it was a mistake lmao), but I think those wide leg denims look great with a clunkier boot. And the tucked in shirt + belt is a good counter to the wide leg. I kind of think I have to copy this outfit?? User 6: This looks great! Great fit! Hope you’re having a great Thursday and thanks for sharing! User 7: This looks great! I second the comments suggesting something more fitted on top so it's a more streamlined fit. I usually wear some sort of heel when I wear wide legged pants (sock boots in the winter, heeled slides for spring/summer).\n",

Check out antique shops or local furniture shops to find something that has some character and is made of solid wood. User 2: Yes, round or oval would look nice. OP: Getting cream and tan/brown throw pillows and blankets to match the rug.  And might get some help lifting the couch so I can slide the rug further up under the sofa.  Edit to Add: Just finished putting together the [TV Stand]([URL] I’m going to do something about that TV wire. Probably when I get the soundbar installed so the Geek Squad can do it all in one go. User 3: I suggest hold off in getting the throw and pillows until you have chosen the tables.  Choose the brown in the fabrics to coordinate with the wood instead of doing random brown color associations. User 4: I like the TV stand styling a lot, but i want it to be 50% bigger, both height and width. It looks weirdly tiny compared to your tv imo. Especially with your TV mounted that high. OP: My record player and speakers is actually going to be on the TV stand which is why I left a large-ish gap. Add some books or a couple of decor items, it should fill up nicely.  I’m also putting up shelves with the same wood tone on either side of it for additional storage/decor. I’ve used up most of the money I set aside for furnishing my first home with the essentials. So I’m buying pieces one at a time whenever I have extra cash after all the bills. User 5: You could also get throw pillows with a touch of teal   [[URL]  &#x200B;  [[URL]  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  [[URL]  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  [[URL] User 6: A coffee table with a cool walnut finish (looks like your sofa legs are this color) and a solid white marble top. Round or oblong would probably be the best shape given the L-shape of the sofa. User 7: I think a light brown leather arm chair would look amazing in this colour pallet. As well as a natural colour wood console table! Maybe some gold accents! User 8: UGH I LOVE EVERYTHING! Seriously you have such good taste, these are stunning. I can't get over the couch.   I'm picturing a mid century wooden coffee table that matches the wood of the legs of the couch. For the accent chair I'm really not sure, I'm picturing a cream chair of some sort, but as a parent to young children, the thought of something that light kind of freaks me out, so I feel like I can't recommend it... Definitely something more neutral because that couch is EVERYTHING OP: Thankfully, I do not have any kids or plan to have them in the near future. But I’m hoping to get a dog soon! User 5: With that couch you will save a lot of grief if you  can get a non-shedding dog.  A lot of breeds and mixes are non-shedding.  But if your heart dog sheds you will just have to vacuum the couch a lot . OP: I have allergies so hypoallergenic, non-shedding dogs are a must for me. I did test the sample of this on my brother’s yorkipoo (pretty much rubbed the sample all over her) and it did pretty well. I just hope Apt2B’s pet friendly labeling is accurate. User 4: I find smooth velvets like how that one looks are surprisingly easy to clean dog hair off of! Depends on the texture of your dog's hair though too. User 8: Yay doggo! I had dogs before I had kids so I know some stuff about dogs and design! My sister got these fancy blankets for her furniture that look like really nice faux fur throws, but are actually waterproof blankets for pets to protect your furniture. There might be other styles too. Or you could train your dog not to go on furniture lol, I've done it with big dogs, but don't have the heart to do it with little dogs (I like the snuggles too much!)   And there's now way more selection of aesthetic dog beds, so you can get one that fits in well in your design, especially if you get a big dog and not allow them on the furniture. I had both, dog beds everywhere and blankets on the couches for my doggo (elderly dachshund with a bad back, so she was only allowed on the couch if we lifted her on and off.) Worked great! User 9: Get a natural wood coffee table User 10: The style and color of the couch – winner! User 11: I would get an oval shaped wood table that matches the color of the sofa legs. Then I would get some cozy cream colored throw pillows so that the sofa ties in with the carpet :) User 12: [Something like this maybe?]([URL] OP: Thanks for the recommendation. It’s not really my style. I like clean lines but I’m thinking of something in that color way if it does not clash with my natural oak TV stand.

We’ve got a couple rugs like that that we wanna replace, because it drives me bonkers OP: I just got it yesterday so it still feels pretty stiff. I’ll see how well it holds up over time. User 16: I would move the rug a bit further under the carpet. User 17: Or maybe the rug should be turned the other direction so the long side is under the long side of the sectional. It's hard to tell without seeing the entire room. User 18: I was about to say the same. Also, then the rug pattern would be at right angles to the floor boards. OP: The rug is just the right size for the sofa. If I flip it to the other side, the legs on the sofa won’t reach the end. Definitely planning on pulling the rug further under the sofa though. It’s a two person job so I have to wait for a bit. User 19: Beautiful couch. Do you have a pic of the tv stand? OP: I just finished putting it together!  [TV Stand]([URL] User 20: What about something like [this]([URL]  Or   [this]([URL] User 21: You have warm, wooden tones in the legs and carpet. Mixing shapes creates a modern look that doesn't take up visual space, so I'd go for an oval or irregular brass table. Something along the lines of this...  [URL] User 22: I’d look for a coffee table wood grain. Same stain as the floor. User 23: I love the couch. Where did you get it? OP: Apt2B. It’s the Scott Sectional in the Peacock Green Performance Velvet fabric. It’s super comfy too! User 24: You have almost the same colors as our living room but in entirely different places.  I dig it! User 25: I loveee a velvet teal couch. Excellent choice. They pair well with brass decor, so because your couch is dark and solid and the rug is printed, I’d go with a round glass + brass table. Like two tiered for storage underneath. Even nesting style coffee table would look nice since you have a wider couch/space. Example: [URL]  For an accent chair I’d go with a tan cognac color pulled from the rug. A leather lounge chair would match the style with your couch :) Nothing too heavy, so having empty space under the seat would work best! Example: [URL] User 26: A thin brighter orange side table?

This was the biggest I could get. If I had gone for a 9x12 rug, I would cover up the vents on the floor.  Planning to pull the rug further under the sofa though. But it’s difficult to do on my own so need to wait until my brother is in town. User 34: Well either way the combo is :chef's kiss:\n",

OP: I might just do that. This is the double bag. OP: The bag you posted looks like their classic Galleria Bag, possible the large? I can’t quite tell but the medium usually looks a little more square than rectangle. This is the Double Bag:  [URL]  They have a number of great light neutral colors and it should be a little lighter to carry than the galleria. OP: Ooohh okay. This is the medium galleria double bag! I think I want that bag you posted since it’s lighter OP: Yeah I have the Galleria in blue and as much as I love it, the weight definitely is a negative. I don’t have a double bag but I have held a few of my friends and they felt lighter! OP: That’s what I should get instead of the same bag! I appreciate your input User 2: I have also debated the same question with a Fendi bag but ultimately decided against it as I would like more variety in styles, especially since these bags are so pricey. I personally think the only bag I would get in multiple colors is the Chanel mini bag. OP: It’s a beautiful bag, timeless shape, size, color, silhouette. OP: Thank you! I feel I did a good investment with this bag User 3: Depends! Do you love the design, the leather finish, or the color? I don't think i'll ever own 2 of the same bag but in different color, i've done it with tshirts or jeans but not bags, but then again someone out there has neverfulls in all sizes and in monogram, DE and DA hahaha if it makes you happy, do it! OP: I think I’m in love that the leather I don’t need to worry about unlike my Gucci or ysl bags. I want something more everyday to wear with lighter colors. User 3: True! I love this bag too but never pulled the trigger to buy 1. I like their cammeo/orchidea color, i think they call it another name these days. OP: I understand! That’s the color I’m looking at. It’s like a tanish color. We will see if something else catches my eye by then. 😂 OP: Yes, get one!! I want a Prada so badly but I recently treated myself to a Givenchy Antigona (my dream bag when I was a teenager lol), and also a Kate Spade off their surprise sale and I can’t justify getting another bag anytime soon. 🙃 OP: My dream bag is a Antigona too. But I know they have strange issues with the leather which makes me think it’s not a good investment. I’m also scared that the base will bow. User 4: Ooooh I just got an Antigona after wanting one forever. They’re so classy! I keep watching IG for Prada deals too - I love the spectrum! User 5: What size double bag is it? Can you compare the size to neverfull? Most of my bags are black or tan- I think it totally makes sense to get both colors. OP: It’s a little smaller than a neverfull. I have one of those but I don’t like anyone can reach in there and can’t be a crossbody when I need it. I think the tan one will be a great choice since I wear this one all the time User 5: I agree about the closure. Which never full do you think, MM or GM? And is this the medium double? Thanks in advance OP: I’m sorry for the confusion. It’s smaller than the MM but the double is meaning it’s got two zipped compartments. Besides the middle where it’s open. It’s honestly I think the size of a PM but heavier User 5: Thank you!! User 6: Buy the tan for spring and summer and put this one away for next fall and winter. OP: You’re so smart thank you!!! User 7: Of course you need another one. Is the tan a warm tan, or more taupe? Taupe is awful, imo. i'll go look, maybe I need a lil something myself. 😇 OP: It’s more like a sandy tan. Taupe would be hard User 8: Gorgeous piece! Don’t let it go! Just get another one in a lighter color. Treat yourself, we’re living in a pandemic. You deserve that bag ❤️ OP: Thank you! I just got so many choices and it’s hard.\n",
            "User 92 - qt511k Original Post: Recently bought a home. I feel like this wall with the pillar looks bare but I don't want to overdecorate. Should I put anything there? Every other wall has something, the tv, large clock, small picture. I don't want to overdo it, but somehow, it seems like something is missing... Suggestions? Image: a living room with blue couch, white table and light colored rug. User 1: A small mirror? User 2: It won’t look so empty if you have a larger side table with a lamp or a plant on it OP: I would've liked a larger table as well but it's a small space right there and I can't fit anything bigger. Taller but not wider. OP: Larger as in longer? I think Iay see what you're getting at. Thank you User 3: Wrap a pothos up the pillar and swap out the short side table for a floating shelf with a lamp (tall but narrow). You can find square-shaped shelves out there, just be careful with height / elbows catching a corner. User 4: Maybe you can pull the end table forward a bit and put a tall thin plant in the corner? OP: That's a thought for sure. I have a small table lamp that turns on automatically for the dogs at night. I hate unsightly wires and the only plug on that wall is behind that small table. Ideally it would be behind the couch, but you know how that goes... so uts tough to figure this out User 5: I’d put the lighthouse on that wall and a large oversized piece of nautical art (or of an abandoned building lol ) on wall behind sofa.  As in, a large statement piece to fill most of the space. OP: Lol yeah...that's the fiances table book lol. She works with mental health patients and thought it was a cool book. She literally asked me, \"do you think that's super weird that I want this book?\" I said whatever floats your boat, I support you lol. It's her house too.  I appreciate the input, the lighthouse picture was a gift and fits the overall theme of the house (mostly) but it does seem to be too small for the space, I agree. Think I'm gonna have to find a new spot for it. It would barely fit on that small wall User 5: Lighthouse will fit the space if it’s not wider than the wall. There doesn’t have to be a border of wall surrounding it. User 6: I would maybe hang something bigger where the lighthouse is or put it to the side and put two smaller pieces up next to it like a gallery wall, and leave the wall with the pillar blank. I think it would be a nice thing to decorate like with a garland or lights for Christmas. User 7: I would leave it or put a floor lamp in the corner OP: I've thought about a floor lamp but I have a tray ceiling with lighting built in, as well as recessed lighting throughout the whole room. I really don't need any more lighting. I appreciate the input. User 8: Nice looking shelves that match the paint of the walls. It won't look empty and won't look like a decoration. User 9: The column is the decoration. User 10: Definitely wall mirror - vertical rectangular or oval shape would fit the space well. User 11: Portrait style art or even a light. A cool, manly light. Amazon has these crows with the bulb in it's feet or something like that.\n",
            "User 93 - dzba53 Original Post: Pretty chuffed at how my space is turning out but I feel like it needs something else ... any tips? Image: a bed and two tables with yellow and white pillows. User 1: A rug! User 2: Yep! A big floor rug with some texture would be really great. OP: Yes! , I have a tiny little white on in front of the desk but I definitely think something bigger with a pop of colour. ☺️ User 3: Plants!! You have amazing windows for some houseplants if you’re into that kind of thing. I love plants and think they add so much character to a room. OP: Thanks! I'll look into some at my local garden centre !  I need to do my research because I've killed lots in the past 😂✨ User 4: Go with a Pothos! They’re hard to kill and look amazing! Especially in hanging planters. Plus succulents. User 5: Snake plants are pretty much imposible to kill, cactus too (I see you have a lot of sun and you don't have to water them much). Mint is also great but you have to water it regularly. User 6: Plants are like anything, practice makes perfect. You'll learn over time what makes them happy.   You definitely need them as you've got a great base here, but the color palette needs to be livened up a bit. Green will be the most natural color to add to your white/yellow base OP: You can also get fake plants! Nowadays they look pretty realistic, they cost the same as normal plants and they take 0 effort to look nice. Ive had to throw away some big houseplants and I always felt so bad about having to throw away that much money because I'm not able to properly care for them and with fake ones you don't have that problem. Also they easily last a lifetime User 7: Finn? This is my favorite post. The room is truly beautiful though and yellow is my favorite color. OP: Thank you ✨ yes I'm fully obsessed with yellow , it has to be everywhere 😂 User 7: Same 😂 my bedroom is navy and blue right now. Do you have yellow photo frames for the wall of another wall art piece with yellow? That may help spread more yellow around visually. OP: I don't but that's a great idea, thank you , I'll do some shopping! User 7: I wanted to add maybe a gold curtain rods or sheer yellow curtain panels to go with the whites. That would add some color to the desk corner! OP: The curtains absolutely need to be higher. That would solve this issue instantly. You don’t have enough wall space for pictures and you dont have much room for plants. Just hang the curtains higher. OP: I'll get on to that, I was planning on sorting that out but I've got no clue how 😂, time to watch a tutorial 😂 User 8: Honestly you can't go wrong hanging them right up at the ceiling, but ideally they should hang to the floor as well.  I agree, a little subtle color to go with one of your accent colors would be great.  Also hanging plants! :D User 9: Do you have room to pull the furniture away so it’s not squishing the curtains as well? User 10: Two ideas: 1 on your desk add something in a contrasting color and a round or oval shape like a blue lamp or a large purple vase. 2.\tYou could consider getting a bench or ottoman for the foot of the bed.  Looks great so far! OP: Thanks, yeah I like the idea of contrasting colours, I'll shop around! :) User 11: area rug definitely! a floofy yellow one would be so cute OP: Yes! I'll have a shop around, something nice and cosy for sure ✨ User 12: That light and air is something else!! Maybe a comfy bench at the end of the bed, and some plants. Every room needs green. User 13: Does the bed have to be blocking the window? Otherwise nice and add some plants! OP: Yeah unfortunately it's too big to move it around the other way, but the general consensus is more green! User 5: >why don't you move the side table to the other side of the bed and you can have a little more room to move the bed away from the window? OP: My mind is telling me something brass and something green User 14: The blue color of that desk chair goes well with your yellow. You have enough light tones, so I’d note for pillow or throw that pick up those kind of dark denim blues a bit. (not actually denim - just that deep rich blue color). User 15: I’d swap out the white curtains for something with some yellow in them. They don’t have to be a solid color but that’d tie the “theme” color in and brighten up the walls a bit! User 16: Speaking of the curtains, I would hang them up a bit higher. User 17: Color on the walls User 18: Oooh the Hemnes bed frame! How do you find it? Is it well built? I saw some reviews that called it really flimsy... I wanted to buy it, but I don't know anyone who has it to provide feedback. OP: I love it, not flimsy at all and I'm a bigger girl and it holds me fine lol User 19: Love it! Only suggestions I would have are more plants and maybe a rug! But honestly you don’t even need that. It’s so bright and looks so comfy. OP: Definitely a big fluffy rug and some plants! And some Edison bulbs for night time! User 20: lamps would be nice! one for the desk and one for the night stand. User 21: I like the rug idea bring in another color to complement the yellow. User 22: I love this so, so much. Yellow is my favorite color and this would be a dream to come home to! Where are those sheets from? User 23: Another color! A deep purple or dark blue. User 24: An adopted pet.  Edit: also an upholstered bench at the end of the bed could be nice/useful. User 25: Fairy lights ❣️🥰 OP: Yessss I had some but they're currently surfing their purpose on my Christmas tree 😂 User 26: Contrast! Adding something blue or purple (maybe a rug or a pillow or two) will really make the yellow pop. User 27: An accent wall with paint or a large, lovely print would be great User 28: An accent color! Maybe a bold rug or a painted wall. User 29: Flower vase User 30: It's very pretty but is missing water and earth. A mirror or clear glass vases and like another poster said plants. User 31: PLANTS\n",
            "User 94 - eog1zp Original Post: Should I put something on the blank wall above the tv between the windows or leave it empty? If so, any ideas what to put there? Image: a living room with a couch, chair and television above the fireplace. User 1: I had 18 foot ceilings at an apartment once and in no budget. I went to goodwill, got a huge ugly horizontal landscape framed monstrosity from the 1970s that was 6 feet by 3 feet for two dollars (I’ve seen them similarly in other thrift stores for five dollars). I told the picture out and overpainted it a solid blue (almost Rothko-ish), put it back in the frame, and changed the wire direction so it would hang vertical- hung it three feet from the ceiling. It looked expensive, looked modern, linked the living area visually to the height,  thirty minutes total and less than ten dollars for paint, wire, and piece.  You could do any color focus or even a gradient. User 2: I’m not even a fan of Seinfeld, and I think nothing should touch that wall unless it’s the Kramer or George paintings. You know which ones I’m talking about. OP: [yes]([URL] User 2: That will really tie the room together User 3: You have inspired me. I think I just found my new focal point. Lol User 4: He is a loathsome offensive brute. Yet I can’t look away. User 5: I want to see like a super old painting of someone's grandfather or like a Victorian gentleman OP: I like this idea! I never thought of that. Thank you User 6: You should commission a painting of yourself in a smoking jacket with a monocle and a pipe and hang that above the tv User 7: Or in a Napoleonic military outfit User 8: I'd put a larger sized vertical painting. Maybe a portrait that looks old fashioned. OP: I don’t have a pet yet but I do love that idea lol  I agree. I might end up doing that or some kind of funny portrait talking piece User 9: A big clock could go down well User 10: Here is what I would do. 1. That rug is way too small for the space.  2. I would never mount my TV above a fireplace. A fireplace is a focal point, and a TV distracts from it. Now you are talking about somethign above it as well, so you will have a column of items and nothing really anywhere else in the room. It will feel very unbalanced. 3. You lack soft lighting. I see one lamp. Need at least 2 more with soft white bulbs. 4. Art work, good quality stuff from artists, or created by you, something with bold colors to contrast the sterile walls.  I am all for minimalism, but the pieces you use must be large enough for the space. Think scale. User 11: I think you forgot “Yank out the silly columns to nowhere.” They seem like far more of an aesthetic problem than the TV. User 12: Do you have any pets or love animals? [Eh?]([URL] [Ehhh?]([URL]  If you want artwork, that spot is so high up you could make something cheap too. The structure you like from target could be made large-scale with straws or chopsticks. User 13: Family portrait User 14: Adams Family portrait User 15: Ok, I've said this before. But since there are so many angles (the windows, architecture, TV, etc.) I would go for something round in that space. User 16: Mirrors are good for bouncing light around. User 15: Since it's already pretty craftsman you could add some wainscoting on the wall jetting out and go up to the ceiling. Don't have to do any decorating afterward. Could do it yourself or with some buddies if you're handy.  Stuff like this: [URL]   [URL] User 17: The thing that jumps to mind is a round iron-work clock, so it's a piece that isn't solid but still fills the space OP: You need to understand that this is wide angle shot. Almost a fish eye lens shot. So the image is very distorted and makes everything in the foreground look a lot smaller than it actually is. Both the furniture and rug are just fine for scale as you can see [here]([URL] and [here]([URL] As far as the TV I’m not going to comment. It works for me and that’s all I really care about. I was only asking about the top area so I appreciate your comments about that! User 10: What design look are you going for? That might help to better  determine what to put there. You have nothing on the walls anywhere else either, so It will look silly with everything in one column over the fireplace.  One of the biggest probelms is little wall space for decor, as there are so many windows. Perhaps free standing art?   This is not an easy room to work with, but if you are happy with it, that is all that matters.   As I said in a different comment, the rug is a bit too small IMO to really anchor the furniture in the space. When I said scale I meant for your wall art if you are going with wall decor in a minimalist design. The space is cavernous.  As examples, see [Here]([URL] or [here]([URL] for rugs. Is it okay to have a smaller rug, yes, but I would not for such a large room. You are not bound by these rules by any means, but just something to consider. User 18: I’d invest in a few neck massage sessions OP: We usually only use it for no more than 30 minutes at a time. It really isn’t that bad User 19: I'm going to run against the grain of this thread and say no, I don't think you should put anything there, and certainly not a framed piece of art. That wall is already very blocky with the windows/fireplace/tv, and it would just be a bit much to add yet another square to make it even busier. Also, it is just too high. This isn't a salon in Paris.   If you were to put something there, I would go for something that shows the wall color through it and is very simple (like one of those abstract metal wire criss-cross pieces). That spot should not be the focus of the room, so don't put something there that feels distracting or like it *ought* to be at eye level (a portrait or something similar). Also, in response to those suggesting a mirror - just no. You'd get a nice reflection of the ceiling which would be pointless. User 20: How about a look a like window to confuse guests that try to figure out how it doesn’t conflict with the fireplace. User 21: TV is WAY too high, even for this sub OP: Not really what I was asking but thanks for the opinion. We have a dedicated movie room with a 120” projector screen so the most we even use this is probably 30 mins at a time and that’s usually when eating a quick meal or also cooking in the kitchen to have some background noise. It works for me so that’s all I really care about.   Also, since I wanted a TV in the living room what would you propose the alternative would be? Rip out the fireplace and put some drywall up just for the sake of a better viewing angle? Or one of those [really aesthetic mantle mounts]([URL] ? Just trying to determine how to put the TV lower since it’s way too high.\n",

I found a house plan I really like but am wondering if this type of foyer causes traffic jams. Thanks! OP: Doesnt cause traffic jams. But there are only two of us :) we dont hang out in this area except when doing laundry or leaving for work.

OP: I love these!!! Thank you SO much. How long should my rug be? From the door to the cutout is 10 feet User 4: Under the door clearance will determine everything. OP: Ok, gotcha. I'm new at this. So when opened my door is 3 feet. So I would place the rug 3 feet from the door? User 4: That is clearance from the opening.  How much space is there between the bottom of the door and the floor.  How much rug can fit under the door? OP: 7/8 of an inch. User 4: Okay, so that's not much space for a rug.  IS the bottom of your door wood or does it have a weather blocking strip? OP: Just wood! User 4: Awesome.  So you could shorten the door and raise the threshold if you wanted to.  The threshold is the floor of the door hole. User 4: Open the door and measure from the bottom of the door to the floor.  Is that what you did to get a gap of 7/8 inches? User 4: Yes, this is also important if the rug won't fit under the door User 4: Measure the floor clearance of your interior closet doors too, if they will be impacted.  If the closet clearance is small, your big rug idea may not work, and you could put a smaller rug at the front door only. User 5: Stay away from earth tones, that is a lot of brown and cream, needs to be broken up. Is there any other color in the adjacent room? User 6: Love that table! Where’d you get it? OP: Amazon! User 1: Link please OP: [URL] User 1: Thanks so much!! User 7: I would put a black and white rug there. It depends on the rest of your color scheme though. Do you have other colors in that area? OP: Right now it's just blacks and whites and brown's. I want a bit of some color. My bathroom next to the front door is a turquoise and peachy thing. Sounds gross but is cute :) User 8: A rug that goes with the vibe of the rest of the house. Take some colors (that stick out through you home) and incorporate them a bit into the pallet of the rug. This way, the house will feel more cohesive User 4: So, the pile height on the pale green rug is .05 inches.  It would work. But it is only 2' x 3' and is a one of a kind, and so it is too small.  The pile on the red rug is also .05.  It is 2'9\" x 5'5\".  You can make a mock rug out of paper or plastic to see the size in situ.  The Muted Blues is also .05, and comes in various sizes.  I think you'll find that the clearance you have on that door will accommodate most rugs.  EDIT:  What about the closet doors though? OP: Hi, thank you so much for all of your help. I really appreciate your guidance. I have been having some trouble with wayfair so I decided to get a runner from amazon. I actually just made a new post about it. But I wanted to express my gratitude and thank you for taking so much time out of your day to help!! User 4: Girl. You do you. That’s the best part of design. Can’t wait to see the photos. User 9: Just make sure you get the under the rug sticky kinda pad so the rug doesn’t move around. It’ll get old reallllllly fast having to fix it all the time.

User 3: Professional checking in and you're on the right track imo. A cool gray wall color and keep the dark floors. Throw in a darker neutral for furniture with splashes of color in art, plants, pillows, rugs and other accessories. Tbh its a damn cozy and interesting space as is. OP: When you say darker neutral for furniture, what color specifically would work best for a couch, coffee table, or tv stand (tv will go on the wall above the stand)? We were thinking of this color couch or similar. Professional suggestions?   [URL] User 4: Either colors of this particular couch would look good here. I really like the blue. User 5: I think the blue is a little dark (I prefer the grey but just get whatever you want) and would recommend either a lighter looking carpet (not recommended if you wear shoes inside) or 2-3 light gray throw pillows that would tie in with the walls or other colors that would be nearby. User 6: I would do a textured gray, similar to [these]([URL] walls. User 7: hah, \"millennial gray\"! Its the modern version of all those old 70's houses that were painted puke green and mustard yellow.  &#x200B;  \\*30 years from now someone looking at an apartment\\* \"Why did everyone want their houses to look like the inside of depressing office spaces?\" User 8: Keep the floor as it is looks amazing. Don’t go crazy with dark furniture as I would be my first instinct. User 9: This. And add a rug in front of the sofa if needed to further break up the flooring color. User 10: I second that-- this floor is dreamy. User 11: If this were your space, what colour would you paint the walls and what colour would you make the furniture? I am curious because the floor is my style but I do not know what would look best with it for walls and furniture. User 12: Keep! User 13: yeah keep, dark floors are awesome and makes it feel more home imo User 14: Floors are BEAUTIFUL. Keep them. User 15: Definitely keep User 16: My ex wife used to have an empty room like this in the house and she would butter the floor and dress me up like a hotdog and roll me around in there for hours User 17: ID on the butter? User 18: Paint the walls maybe if you like but good god keep those beautiful hardwoods User 19: Instead of the floors just repaint all the walls white and paint out the window casings in white. It'll offset the dark floors and make everything pop. User 20: Keep the floor. Add a rug to break up the space User 21: Mate, did you move into the place I was just helping work on? Illinois? OP: NYC here User 21: Damn, two houses over from me looks creepily exactly like that in the front room and I was about to say I'd offer help with any work you'd want, I'd know the wiring enough xD  Looks nice though man, good luck getting it all set up User 22: Keep the dark floors and go for green shade for the walls. Put up some chair railings to class it up. User 23: Keep them, paint the walls a light gray, try gray owl from Benjamin moore User 24: Are you renting? Fuck it, leave it. User 25: The real enemy here is the dark frames on those windows User 26: Keep the floors. Try and get baseboard heaters to replace those big radiators. User 27: Dark floors show EVERY dust bunny.

Paint your walls a nice earth tone, a warm grey would look great. Keep the trim white. User 31: Have you considered plastic along all the walls, floor, and ceiling? That hanging light is fantastic. User 10: CFor some reason I’m thinking of Cincinnati when I see this User 32: For the floor stay as is. They're great and easy to clean. Just buy some rugs. Get some long curtains to cover the windows. I think an ash grey would be great. Then you can check out some of wall arts here.   [[URL] User 33: Keep.

It’s not even July and I’m dying. User 35: I like the dark floors User 10: Where are you? Color is important in you location. User 36: If you want to bring a more dramatic feel into the room when you get to the color/decor part, the dark floors would be great. I've seen pastels look like a million on a floor like that, it really can support any strong design and style.  All the fuss about dust - you swiffer for 2 minutes - done.  The thing to remember is you're going to add rugs, and you can do that in any way you like - you can lay a mosaic of old rugs that leave islands or paths of floor; just laying down a large  jute rug or colorblock rugs will give you a lighter floor.  The windows are a bit tragic. :) If you get to do the windows, maybe look for hopper frames, and consider making a garden window into a feature. They don't have to go into the kitchen, if you have a green thumb you've just given yourself a great display for the hobby, and it increases the amount of light that comes into the room, opens the room to the outdoors - which is healthy.  Whatever is behind that little door either wants a bigger door or one of those click doors that merge into the wall.\n",

Image: a living room with a lot of furniture and windows. User 1: I second the comment about ivory. Ivory, cream or off white would really brighten the space.   My other suggestions would be to mount the tv. I'd replace the blinds with floor length curtains. A bigger coffee table. User 2: Mount the TV, ditch the brown thing it’s sitting on, and slide the white cube shelf under it.  Put some bins in the cube shelf. User 3: Is this a rental?  What color is the sofa?  In a perfect world, one fewer chair, drapes, larger rug, tv console (and wall mount the tv), and the white storage things seem a bit incongruous in here...

In all seriousness, the rug is basically 6'x9'. User 3: Yes....you need to go up a size or two (preferably 2).  Some should sit under the front legs of the sofa. OP: Yes, it is a rental. The sofa is green and red primarily but there's also a bit of brown and tan in it.   Both the butterfly chair and brown lazy boy will be gone in a month as one roommate is leaving an another is coming. If I were to a eliminate a chair which position is superflous in your opinion? User 3: I think the one next to the white storage unit, but without a floorplan, that's just based on what I see.  So with the lazy boy gone, just put it there to see if it works.  As far as color goes, it's bit dim in here.  Consider changing out the bulbs if you want to brighten things up.  Obviously shades make a difference, but a higher Kelvin should also change the look of things.  The first pic below shows it...[[URL]  ETA If you need the blinds for privacy or light blocking, then they have to stay, but there is a temp fix if not. User 6: I agree with going lighter, ivory/light beige would work well. Also if you can, get a rug that is big enough so at least the front legs of the furniture sit on it. OP: Yeah, the rug is 6'x9', so maybe 7'x10' would be ideal. I've been increasingly considering tan or ivory. My only fear was the color being too close to the chair in the corner. User 6: I think you can go bigger than that- more like 8x10. If you are worried about it matching the chair maybe choose something that has multiple shades of ivory and tan in it? Post updated pics when you make the swap! User 7: your rug needs to be at the end of the couch. User 8: I agree with the cream/ivory rug suggestions (and larger/anchored), mounting the tv and curtains.  One quick thing would switch the position of the brown armchair with the butterfly chair. Currently you have the two visually heavier chairs on one side. OP: The chair thing is a really good point, I didn't think of that but it's quite obvious now you point it out. I'm slowly building my interior design eye.   In a month my roommate is leaving and taking the butterfly chair AND the big brown lazy boy. So I'll have the opportunity to get some different things. At the very least a new butterfly chair for the corner by the couch. User 9: ivory User 10: NGL, I'm digging the plaid couch bigtime!  I agree with the other posters that a larger, lighter rug would be nice.  I would love to see the white storage and TV storage piece replaced with one longer piece - the wood colour is nice. OP: Glad you like the plaid couch, it took some time to grow on me. Got if for free from a friend. It's been a particular challenge to decorate around though because the rug can't have any pattern or it clashes. User 11: You could look into a Sure Fit slipcover for the couch. My husband's grandma gave us a comfy chair that was plaid. Got a cover for it to match our color palette. User 12: How adventurous are you? I love the plaid sofa but would add some color with a large persian rug with burgundy and blues.  Mixing the patterns similar to this   [URL] OP: Huh, I would've thought a patterned rug would clash with the plaid. The pic you shared does look good though, but I'm not sure I could pull it off User 12: What vibe are you going for? Lodge? Rustic? I'm assuming you're trying to work with what you have/keeping within a budget.  So how about this when the butterfly chair and brown recliner are gone:  Slide everything toward the window by about a foot.   Move the white unit to where your shoes are. Cut up & insert a few squares of an old outdoor or rubber doormat and use the bottom cubes to store your shoes.    I agree with the other suggestions of either mounting the TV on the wall or getting a proper stand for it if it's going to stay on that brown cabinet.   Shift the cream chair to the opposite side of the room so it faces the window and can share the side table with the sofa.    If it's in your budget, find a large green plant like a fiddle leaf fig or birds of paradise or even a potted plant on a tall stand and place in the corner (under the animal skull).  Get a few chenille or other soft throw blankets for the sofa& chair and (here's the big one!) if you're feeling bold, maybe try a rug like this (in the dark red) for your room: [URL]  If you need additional seating, you should have enough room to put a small footprint chair of your liking (another butterfly chair, a narrow brown leather clubchair or wing chair) either placed opposite the cream chair or in the corner (where the cream chair is now).  Good luck! User 13: Maybe a lighter coir to brightening up the room User 14: I would go with off white and green. User 15: I would also love to see a rug with tan and/or  cream colors. I think another piece of art to the right of the TV mounted on the wall would be nice. I would also like to see a leafy green plant. If budget allows, perhaps a new coffee table. OP: Where would a good place for a plant be? I have a fake fern on my porch I could bring in. I've been iffy about the coffee table myself. It's a hand-me-down from my great grandparents. But it's kind of weird it being curved like that. User 15: I think putting a plant on top of the white shelf near your window would look nice. Plants filter the air and many are pretty easy to care for. If its a family coffee table you should keep it. :) Just thought it was a little small. User 16: Sandy, fluffy, bigger. It will give coziness User 17: Pull a color from the sofa...do you prefer a lighter look? I’d go with a tan color, it would work with your furniture. A darker vibe, maybe a deep green. That picture above your sofa is awesome, how about a shade out of that? A golden, be bold and go red! Basically, what ever makes you smile, that’s what to go with. Doesn’t matter if no one else likes it, our homes should make US feel good and smile. Have a good time decorating! And let us know what you end up choosing!!!! By the way, what a beautiful space you already have! User 18: Along with the rug suggestions, I would throw in matching throws over the couches. Mainly to soften all the straight lines (the curvy coffee table is a nice contrast)  You could also add in some natural shapes and lines like a basket filled with blankets, or plants...etc User 19: Def a lighter color, creams, maybe a mix that has low pile with some areas of a bit higher pile. Adds interest. User 19: If you got a cream color you could get a couch throw in a cream color to balance out your room. User 20: Take it from someone who bought ivory rugs and then placed them on the floors of her home- they look absolutely lovely when they are ivory, but not so lovely when just a little bit of unexceptional foot traffic turns them gray (we are clean people, we aren’t tracking anything exceptional into the house.). Rugs are much more expensive to have professionally cleaned than floors (why?) and DIY cleaning just doesn’t really get the trick done. If by chance you are on a budget- rethink the ivory suggestion. If budget is not a concern, ivory would look delightful. OP: I'm willing to spend $150 on the rug. There's an ivory shag rug at Wal-mart I could get. My only worry is, I already got a grey/silver shag rug and returned it because it looked weird. Ivory isn't too far different from grey. User 20: I think you’ll find Ivory to make the plaid pop in a way the silver was unable to do. Give it a go! User 21: You could try a rich red to match the couch pillows! OP: Update: So I got a rug, it's smaller than I would've liked but I think the pattern is perfect. It's nothing super impressive but I think the fact that it blends in as opposed to looking out of place means it's a good choice.  I've included close-ups of the rug and couch pattern for comparison.  [[URL]   [[URL]   [[URL]   [[URL]  Also one of my roommates has a love seat (not sure the design) we could bring in once the chairs are gone so that adds more potential. User 15: Are the first two pictures of the old rug or the new rug? Can you move the rug closer to the couch?\n",

But what types of bottoms would I pair with such a top combination? It would feel a bit fancy I imagine, but would matching jeans work or maybe a long skirt of some sort? User 2: np! I would style is with a black corset and black mini skirt, or a more neutral colored corset (brown, olive green) and flare jeans. User 3: OMG CUTE. for a more trendy look I would DEFINITELY wear this with baggy jeans and a chunkier sneaker. For jackets maybe just a shirt jacket OP: That's such a good idea!

Do you know of any alternatives or brands that aren't as heavy on the wallet? User 3: Definitely check out asos for any shoes. They can be super cheap and they’ve always been great quality for me.

            "User 100 - vs1v8o Original Post: Blank Slate- Where do I put my TV and how should I arrange sofas, etc. Image: the interior of an empty room in a house. OP: Room is 15 ft x 19 ft.  I have painted the walls greige since this picture was taken.  No interest in TV above fireplace.  Thanks! User 1: You say you have no interest in TV above fireplace likely because you're wise enough to not want the TV too high to watch comfortably. However, have you considered a TV mount above the fireplace that pulls down to the correct height? Look up \"Mantelmount\" as an example. OP: Yeah I looked into mantelmount, they even have some really cool motorized models.  In this case we will likely be watching a lot of TV in this room, so if the TV is above the fireplace, likely most of the seating will result in having to turn your head 90 degrees one way or the other to watch the screen, which isn't great ergonomically.  Maybe there's a way to do it that avoids that, but that was my first thought. User 1: Maybe I'm missing something, but why not have your seating facing the fireplace+TV? Floating couches have been a thing for a while, you don't need to slap it against a wall. User 2: If you don't want to the put the tv above the fireplace, isn't there only one other wall in this room? User 3: My problem with this room would be having the light shining on the TV screen all the time. I'd watch the light from the windows and see how far it reaches onto the right wall. If the light wouldn't hit the height of the TV screen, I'd put it against that wall, otherwise I'd try diagonally in the corner on the left of the fireplace if you could get it at an angle that the light won't hit the front of it. Particularly look at the time that you would most likely be watching tv if the light is shifting a lot through the day. User 4: Or just get blinds or curtains that can block the light when TV is going User 3: Sure, I’d just rather keep curtains and blinds open during the day if it’s possible. OP: That was my first thought too!  I already ordered motorized blinds so that I can schedule them with the sun to avoid TV glare :) User 5: Since placement above the fireplace is out, I see two options.   First option: place tv in the corner between the fireplace and window and get an L shaped sectional sofa. Arrange with the long side of sectional sofa opposite the windows, the shorter side facing the fireplace. In this scenario I’d put a row of low bookshelves under the full length of the windows. I’d get a vintage Lane Acclaim triangular/corner shaped side table for under the tv (mostly because I am already pricing one online as I have the matching coffee table and the lower shelf is practical for under tv equipment). Really any corner-friendly shaped end table or desk would work but I always lean toward vintage stuff. If more tv equipment space is needed beyond corner table, flank with smaller cube shelves (or something similar in size). Put slim profile a console or sofa table behind the short side of the sofa like another post suggested.   Option 2: Put tv on lower profile media console table opposite fireplace. Put a long sofa on wall side of fireplace, facing 2 comfy armchairs on the window side of fireplace. Place a side table between chairs, get ottomans if space allows, rectangular coffee table in center. You could also do two sofas flanking the fireplace but that might be too formal, less comfortable imo.   I’d put shelves going up both sides of the fireplace, preferably built-in with maybe a cabinet on the bottom, sort of like fireplaces in craftsman homes (I’ll link some photos). You might even consider a beadboard (I think that’s what it’s called) 3/4 height chair rail or wallpaper on the fireplace wall to help ground the space since the ceiling is so high. Wall art will also be key, I’d get a mix of pieces, including something large but not too large for the wall opposite the windows. A couple of floor lamps would a good idea. I love those chrome arc eyeball lamps for a big space. Also some plants!   I’d put a darker colorful area rug under the full the seating area (like a classic Persian style, w warm deep jewel tones, crimson reds, golds etc.) to ground the space so your eye is drawn down as well as up to the high ceilings. Just get one large enough for the space, fitting under all the seating furniture pieces.  With the tv on a lower profile console facing into the seating area and fireplace, if you center it on the stairway wall, you could extend the stairway wall with a higher profile bookshelf or slim profile console directly behind the tv to serve as de facto room divider and to protect it from tipping while concealing wires etc. Or perhaps you could have something custom-built to extend from the stairs for this purpose.  I’d advise bamboo blinds/shades for sun glare on the tv during the day/early evening. Especially important if the windows face due west or due east if there are windows directly across the street that can reflect sun glare directly into your eyeballs (my unfortunate giant fireplace room set up taught me this the hard way). Bamboo would warm up the space and still block light/glare. I like roller shades as you can adjust them. Louvred shutters would also look nice, painted to match the trim.   It’s a great space so whatever you do, enjoy!   Links:  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  [URL] OP: Appreciate the time you put into this, thank you!  I really like the bookcases idea, and I'm sure my wife will like it even more than me haha User 6: PAINT IT WHITE DEAR GOD OP: Literally the first thing I did after buying the house haha.  Well not WHITE white, but a subtle greige. User 6: Thank goodness User 7: This is a dream place for having a video projector. Put your couches on the window side and mount your projector above the couches. You can decorate the area around the screen with plants. It will be a cool place. OP: Interesting!  I was originally thinking maybe a projector screen that came down in front of the middle windows (I already ordered motorized blackout curtains for them).  My only concern is that maybe there's too much ambient light from other windows nearby and the bay window above? User 8: No tv over the fireplace! OP: Agree! User 9: I would do a big L shaped sectional, facing the TV with the other leg of the L on the wall with really high ceilings (facing window). I’d throw a console table behind the back of the couch that you face when you walk in so you can throw keys on as it seems this is directly off the entrance to the house. I’d mount the TV over the fireplace as there’s already hookups, and put a chase or chair in the corner between windows and fireplace facing the couch for a cozy little nook   Edit- just saw your comment about no TV above fireplace. Whoops. - in that case I would just flip the L for the couch to be in the window side. Have TV on big wall, chase pounds in opposite corner. Only problem is TV going to get swallowed up by that wall. TV height is going to be eye level and there will be a lot of dead space above. OP: That was my biggest concern too, that wall is so huge, I don't even know where to start with it haha.  I see so many people getting roasted for putting their TVs above the fireplace, I don't want that to be me! User 9: Don’t let Reddit comments dictate how you design the space you’ll probably spend the most time in!!! Do your thing. I think you should hang some artwork. You can go a little higher than you would with a TV. And you can get some tall indoor trees to add some height to that wall and flank whatever art work you decide to hang up. User 10: Sofas/sectional against windows with Tv on opposite wall User 11: If possible throw out fireplace It's ghastly.use that wall for seating plus wall opposite windows. Tv under staircase wall (perhaps lose portion of banister to accommodate tv hight.)small bookcase under windows (that light begs to have a good book read in it) with a few plants on top. Nice piece of art above where the fireplace was (full color as it'll be providing the warmth in the room)and if you can stand it (I cant) a large low coffee table, in that space with your light requirements I'd opt for glass, tho personally I'm all for extra storage which depending on your taste would either be bleached pine or super dark like a Japanese lacquer. Whatever you decide to do I'd love to see your finished result. User 12: What color sofa do you want to buy\n",

I definitely think I'm going with ruggable User 3: another vote for ruggable! the standard mat the rugs come with takes some getting used to if you’re expecting typical rug cushioning, but it’s great imo. User 4: Can you expand on how the mat is different from typical rug cushioning. User 1: It’s like a thin velcro layer, you peel the rug off to wash it and replace it OP: Thank you!!!  I've been thinking of trying them out for sure! OP: I just redid this room. My home is 130 years old, so there is no closet in the master bedroom. I think it used to be a parlor honestly. Anyway, I absolutely love how my laundry room came out, especially my closet solution. However, I think it needs a rug to feel cozier. Because of the wallpaper, I'm unsure what kind of rug would look nice there. User 5: Your laundry room/closet idea is genius OP: Thank you so much! I love it now! It used to be so ugly lol.

I wish I had the space for this User 7: I saw this as I was dragging my laundry downstairs to the communal machines, jealous doesn’t begin to cover it lol   What about a shaggy green rug, the same shade as the green on your gorgeous wallpaper?? OP: Oh no!! Communal machines are the worst. I'm sorry!   Oh I love that! Shaggy would be nice and cozy for sure. I hadn't thought of matching greens. That's definitely a great idea. Also thank you! I stumbled upon that wallpaper on etsy, and designed the room around it. I love it so much! User 7: I think that would be super cute and cozy and warm! You could even do a large circle rug in the middle of the room.   Plus if a spill happens it probably wouldn’t be too obvious on the green OP: Thank you so much! Totally different direction than I was thinking, but I love it. It's a pretty big room, so I think that could be great User 8: I would do an indoor/outdoor area rug. That way, if detergent spills on it or something, you can just take it outside and hose it off. That what I do in my basement laundry room. OP: Spills are definitely something to think about! Thank you! User 9: Any color close to one in the beautiful wallpaper would go nicely. Even a blue like your hangers would compliment the room. OP: Thank you!!! That blue is definitely my favorite color! It pops up in other places throughout the house, so maybe that's a good direction to go. User 10: Maybe a couple of runners in front of the machines and in of clothes racks. OP: That would definitely help define the spaces. Thank you! User 11: Omg, laundry IN your closet?! That’s the best idea I’ve ever heard User 12: This is so cute!!!! My house is 80 years old and I don't have a closet in my bedroom either. I might steal this idea!! OP: Thank you so much!! This used to be my least favorite room in the house. When we moved in it was green with splotches of green on the ceiling. One wall was mysteriously left beige, and we quickly installed one of those home depot closet world set ups. It was cluttered and ugly. The closet change was kind of last minute, because I didn't want to hide the wall paper. It was SO easy, and I love it! I think Alexandra Gater did something similar in a video.

User 1: I think you should paint it the same color as the walls. It will blend in and not stand out as a big piece of furniture. OP: It doesn't really stand out as such a big piece of furniture actually User 1: It would if you painted it white. User 2: My rule for painting is if I want to draw attention to something I paint it a different color than the background color. (Like attractive woodwork, for example, or an accent wall). If it’s a distraction or unattractive or simply shouldn’t be a focal point, it gets the same color as its surroundings. (So conduit mounted on the wall, or trim that there’s solely to cover a seam between panels or a ventilation drill, or a closet that doesn’t have lovely decorative lines).   If you’re closet had pretty doors and woodwork, I’d do the wall parts of it to match the walls in the room and the doors to match the woodwork. Yours as it is? Add as many  coats of the current color as needed to get a good finish and no show through User 3: The same color as the walls! Just add another coat (or two?) and it would be lovely and create a better blank backdrop for your more aesthetic furnishings/art. OP: Please note, the room is really dark because there a coating on the window. I've opened the window to take the picture so the picture is actually much more ligther than it would be (tho I took the picture in the evening so there wasn't much light).           When I painted the walls I spilt some paint on the closet door and went \"whatever\" and painted one layer quickly over the entire thing, but I'm not sure I do want keep it that colour (with a new coat of  paint ofc). My mom who's helping me is very set on that I should paint it white but I'm also not so sure on that. User 4: Aesthetically, I agree with your mom, but I think painting it white, now that it is dark green, is going to be very difficult to achieve..Whichever color you choose, you’re probably going to have to prime it to keep that dark color from showing through. User 5: Black or a dark gray would cover the blue more easily than white. White would look fine but stand out a lot. Or you could add more color by painting it a dark mossy green or plum. User 6: GOLDEN OP: If I keep it green I'm definitely getting golden handles,   or I wonder if I should paint it ocher yellow, but I think the whole thing as 'actual' golden is a little too much for my taste.        (But gold and dark green DO look nice together :D) User 7: Coral or kind of mustardy gold User 8: Brilliant Cobalt Blue with gold trim and hardware User 9: If you wanted to make the closet stand out you could look into some fun temporary wallpapers that are made for apartments with some patterns to make a statement. Maybe add some trim if you did that. User 10: maybe something more creative than painting just a color... perhaps use a chalkboard paint or cover it with a collage of personal photos. The closet itself isn’t necessarily a display piece, but you could decorate it in a personal way with photos that make you feel nice :) perhaps using command strips to attach a lightweight full length mirror would be nice?

Image: a bed room with two pairs of shoes on top of it. User 1: Anything black here is some inspo.   [[URL] OP: Thanks User 2: These go with so much, black trousers/jeans obviously, then tops in red or blue, with some white thrown in. Dark jeans with a white top, even better if the top has some of the same colours as the Jordans on. Or the same jeans, white top & hoody/jacket in black & navy/ black & red, although the black & navy will probs be more versatile.  Idk your style but you are bound to find a sweatshirt/hoody/tshirt with the same colours on. A black t-shirt with red detail obvs would look good. Loads of sports & Street West has big colourful designs on atm, so it's a good time to buy co-ordinating pieces.  Or you can go all black with just a bit if colour to match, so like black trousers, black shirt worn open with a black & red top worn under the shirt. Flannel shirts of a similar colours look good too,be specially in the colder months. Also a matching hat if that's your style.  Finally I recommend looking up both current streetwear styles & retro styles to get some inspiration. Obvs oversized is in but personally I think with hi tops you should go for a slimmer leg bottom with a baggier top. User 3: Black jeans, black tee and a red and black check shirt for the red AJ1s is a solid fit. User 4: You could go in a retro direction with skinny/straight white jeans\n",

User 4: I'm useless here but came to say I love the wallpaper! User 5: Came here to say the same thing User 6: Same! 🤩 User 7: Agree that adding shelves would be great. How about painting the white part black to contrast the wallpaper?  *ETA- some dark wood rustic shelves, then some copper storage accents - oh that would look good!! User 8: Add pictures of an exasperated Nicolas Cage between the bees User 9: this wallpaper is screaming for a honeycomb shaped shelf above the toilet User 10: Add some plants and wax candles! Floral scents :). Yellow hand towels. Maybe a bold yellow black scheme. Love the wallpaper. User 11: I'm curious, is this a house built before plumbing and that white section hides all the plumbing? I know my friends had an old Victorian house and their bathroom floors were 6 in higher than the rest of the house to hide on the plumbing...  Anyway, I like the idea of the shelf a lot! OP: The house is only 40 years old but the previous owners did some interesting things with the plumbing - there is a lot of white boxes around it! User 11: Interesting! I wonder if that was meant to make it more accessible...   Oh well, it gives a character! User 12: The shape of that bulkhead/pipe covering thing bothers me so much, I’d be tempted to paint it. Maybe make it look like a honeycomb, with the side cut out of it or something.  That, or paint it black and then paint a few yellow bees on it.  I have no idea if these are good ideas, lol, just spitballing. User 13: I have a suggestion for the white bulkhead area. Floating shelves of some beautiful kinds thick wood. Then put some plants on the shelves. For the recessed area I’d hang a mobile maybe off a piece of driftwood with some sea glass, or something You could do a black molding too at ceiling & baseboards.   Edit: I thought the recessed area was white. User 14: Something a bit left of field, a hanging plant over the top, then plants and candles and maybe little oddities on the shelf over the toilet, then on the white beam that goes all the way up, lots of weird little pictures in frames User 15: I would take quite a few ideas here and paint the white a creamy honey color, perhaps rag roll it tongive it some depth. Add dark wood shelves flush with the (current) white part, and find those hexagon mirror doo dad's and group them randomly on the face of the (current) white part. Put some plants on the shelves, add a couple of sunflower stems in an interesting container. User 16: If you choose to, then once the sunflower has bloomed and before it begins to shed it's seeds, the head can be cut and used as a natural bird feeder, or other wildlife visitors to sunflowers to feed on. User 17: Giraffe User 18: White shelves for decorations and storage. It's already a busy background so I'd stick with solid coloured bins and canisters. Tp, cleaning supplies, etc. would store well there. User 19: beehive vase User 20: Designing this space is beeyond my skill set. User 21: Sunflowers!!! User 22: Disclaimer: not a professional.   Add a hive for all your bees. That’s it, just a hive.  Edit: this comment is for comedic purposes only. Please do not take this seriously. User 23: A stuffed animal of Pooh Bear standing with his red balloon, trying to get to a bees nest up above.  With Pennywise in the corner behind the toilet emerging from a drain. User 24: I would paint it dark green, and do raw wood shelves in the gap above the toilet. User 25: I'd put in some shelves for storage and decor. User 26: Paint the wood part an accent color. User 27: I think painting where it’s white a hunter green (or any other accent color you like) and copper accents added would look so good!! User 28: Pain the white section beige, the closest colour to match the background colour of the wallpaper, then your eye won't be drawn to it.  Anything bee themed, hexagons will go well as they are more irregular shaped. Stay away adding squares or rectangles as it will just highlight the uneavenness. Ovals could also work as they are the shape of the bees & none angular.   I think gold decorations would go great. Bee decorations are pretty popular atm, so I'm sure you will find things you like. User 29: I second the idea of adding some shelving with plants! Fake plants if you don’t want to worry about them. User 30: Paint wide black and yellow stripes add black floating shelves (in the black stripes) and place a picture of Jerry Seinfeld’s character Barry B. Benson on one of them. User 31: Small Wall Art User 32: Just bee creative User 33: Missing a beehive in the upper corner. User 34: Maybe a shelf in the height of that weird corner and then another one half way? Sadly, your room doesn't seem to have natural light, does it? Otherwise I would put lots of hanging plants on the top shelf. OP: Yes, I think something at that height to kind of hide that corner is a good idea. I took the photo at night, there is a large window, so hanging plants could work! User 35: Removing that wallpaper should be the first step User 36: It’s gotta go.\n",
            "User 106 - gba7ij Original Post: My attempt at a stylish bachelor pad. Thoughts on how I might improve? Image: a living room has a gray couch and wooden floors. User 1: Change the lighting to warm lighting, its much to cold. OP: I think the white balance was off on my camera, they do look much cooler than they look IRL. User 2: Bigger rug, another breakfast stool (rule of 3s), and face the lamp into the room. Also the foot stool should go on the side of the coffee table, where a chair would have gone. Lay the front of it on the rug just like a chair. User 3: Came here to find this, get a rug that touches all furniture in the vicinity to tie the space together. User 4: Rules of three? Go on... User 5: He's probably talking about the three sea shells. User 6: Get some nice art above that tv OP: It's quite barren, isn't it. Thinking narrow and wide? User 7: Yes. If you're able to, spray the ceiling black. I know it sounds crazy but I've seen it in other rooms similar to yours and it looks awesome! Give it some thought. 👍🏻 OP: Its a rental so no dice on the spray. Sounds really interesting though! User 8: You could ask the landlord for permission! User 9: Why would you use your own money to inprove someone elses property? User 10: Because you're the person that has to live in it, and you may as well enjoy where you live? User 11: Why would the property owner spend money to paint the ceiling a different color just because the tenant thinks it’ll look nicer with their layout?  If you lease a car do you expect the dealership to upgrade your rims because it’ll look cooler? User 9: Nobody ever mentioned that. And I don't understand why you're responding to me with that. User 11: Ah sorry I thought you were implying the landlord should pay it. It’s too early. My bad. User 12: Because the tenant pays monthly to live in the space, and if the LL wanted to long term happy tenant then the LL would try to accommodate. If the tenant is unhappy with something, LL should listen. Losing rent costs for a month or two is more expensive than getting some painters to paint a ceiling in a few hours.   Please don't buy real estate. User 13: This is an amazing space and def really fun to work with. Is this in NYC? If so - you did well, man! Dream apt.   I'd get another stool so you have 3 and a bigger rug - you'll see a pretty dramatic difference from that alone. For the rug, think of warm and lush. Google \"warm colors\" and choose whichever one you are drawn to -- and get in a texture that feels very luxe... the exposed ceiling (which I love), white walls, and light wooden floor make the room a bit cold so you just need to balance that out with warmth to cozy it up.  From there, get a side table next to the couch. Find somewhere to put all of your bottles - maybe a bar cart on that wall between the kitchen island and the window/patio. Def more plants - you have a lot of windows in the room so they'll probably live just fine. You need big, warm, lush plants also. On that note, you have a large windowsill in your kitchen - if you cook a lot, might be worthwhile to grow some herbs there. Functional, fun, and pretty to look at.  Get new light bulbs that are yellow-y to warm up the space.  Clean up the clutter on all your surfaces and find a method for organizing them so your surfaces are a mix of functional and decorative. Think of where you tend to gather clutter so you can strategize how to outsmart future you. User 14: Great space!!!  What couch is that??? Looks very nice. OP: Thanks! The sofa is Room and Board Andre 101\". It looks great I agree, but honestly, not the most comfortable. User 14: Awesome thanks! User 14: If you're looking to waste a bunch of time during quarantine try shining those copper pipes. User 14: Looks good... get speakers off the floor though ;) User 15: Fantastic, love it!  The *only* thing I can think of to improve is to switch out the yellow rug to a patterned black and white to get that coffee table and couch to really pop User 16: I think I would go slightly larger in the rug too if possible. Check out recommendations for rug sizes in different furniture layouts OP: I've been thinking the same thing... It looked fine until I moved back the sofa and put the rug under it. In my defense, the rug came with me from my last place. OP: Thanks! I'll check out some rugs! I thought the contrast with the sofa was good but you're right, the coffee table kinda disappears. User 3: Or you could move the rug, couch, and coffee table closer to the TV but I’d get a bigger rug instead. It’s the only pop of color you have in the apt so go big and bold (think of it as art on the floor). User 17: Awesome bachelor pad! Where did you get the speakers from? User 18: Needs a rug, eames chair, plants User 19: Paint the walls, shimmering anthracite for example. User 20: Lots a concrete (or looks like). Contrast it with more natural features! A tall standing plant would go great in that corner near that white lamp. Alternatively, maybe a ladder bookshelf to put knick-knacks and plants on. User 14: I think you need artwork and some more personal items displayed so it looks like a home rather than a prop User 21: Man I need to move out of NYC. What city is this? Love the space. User 22: Ya nailed it!! Just add some more wall art above the tele. User 23: Maps and plants.  They work for any decor. User 14: With your color scheme, a nice light green (chair, painting, plants) would compliment the yellow rug and contrast the grey and brown. User 24: Spend whatever you feel appropriate to fill out that wine rack. Also get some plants, hanging if you don't have floor space for regular, look up their care, it's not that hard, pretty much just need 1 pints of water a week for most medium-large plants in summer and 0.5 in winter. If leaves are yellowing, stop watering, if they're yellow with brown tips, more water, less sun. Some will prefer to be by that window, others away from the window, research accordingly. And if you want them to look really healthy, mist their leaves with water a few times a week User 25: Paint and clean up those pipes. User 26: Honestly just clear nearly everything off the sink counter and organize/get rid of clutter. User 27: Get a more powerful and bigger rag. Additional to this, get some nice curtains. The rag just don't match with the wooden furniture and the floor. Get yourself a blanket in black&white to slap over the sofa. Get rid of the little foot bench infront of the couch and put it somewhere else. Make some more warm light by putting nice lamps in the corners. Get some plants that have big foliage. Just some. Like a nice bananaplant or a fiddle leaf fig but make sure they are standing near the window. User 28: get those speakers off the floor for starters. User 29: Mount that TV and hide the cables User 30: This looks amazing! I'm imagining the clear bottle being whiskey that you used in the Instant Pot for a delicious beef recipe. The one thing you could improve is to give me that recipe! Take care and be well! OP: Thanks! That bottle is actually a wine growler of all things. While I do have a whiskey collection (you can kinda see it in front of the fridge), I don't have a good beef recipe that isnt \"throw on a hot cast iron\". What I do have is an Asian pork instapot recipe that's bomb.\n",

            "User 108 - lsslls Original Post: Ugly kitchen in new rental, need advice on how to make it not suck. Image: a room with a chair, a sink, refrigerator and microwave. User 1: I would def do a peel-and-stick backsplash, it'll make a big difference. Instead of covering the cabinets in vinyl like someone suggested, I'd cover the countertops in vinyl/contact paper of some sort. You could do a dark grey concrete vinyl for example, but there's tons of options out there. It'll take some finessing to make it look right but it'll definitely easier than covering all the cabinets which sounds like a nightmare lol. Depending how much you wanna do you could also replace the cabinet hardware, with black or brass knobs for example. User 2: This is the one. The peel and stick backsplash and vinyl stick-ons for the countertops with some new hardware if you plan on staying for a while. OP: Thanks for the advice. I'm here for at least a year now. I do think fresh hardware and a change to the counter top color would be a big improvement. User 3: Since it’s a rental you’re kind of stuck with the suck. You can add some art to the area above the cabinets, some colorful magnets on the fridge and stove, or maybe paint if you’re allowed. User 4: Make your kitchen items -bowls, utensil holders, appliances - your decorations. magnets onf the fridge, and certain plants/small prints.  I wouldnt call it an ugly kitchen, I would say its plain. User 5: It's not ugly, it's just plain basic one.   I would not spend money on sticker tiles. You can't re-use them somewhere else, because dimensions would probably be different, and they may damage the backsplash.   Hang curtains, get nice placemats, chair pads. Get colorful appliances, ceramics, etc, - there are tons of nice kettles, toasters, soap containers, jars for pasta etc.   Add peel and stick LED lights under cabinets. OP: Thanks for the input; I agree once I get my countertop appliances unpacked and some decorating done, it will look much better. I considered the peel and stick backsplash, as others had mentioned, but you raise a good point. User 6: I actually really like it! Be deliberate about where you place your countertop appliances to avoid a cluttered feel, light up all the under-cabinet areas, and hang colorful stuff on the sides of the cupboards by the sink. User 7: Paint the walls and see if you can get new appliances...other then that, I wouldn't mess with the cabinets or light fixture...you can add like a fake backsplash... OP: Unfortunately, I can not paint or change the appliances. I think with some color added with utensil holders and countertop appliances, it will really change the feel of things. User 7: Dang. Painting it would have been your best bet 🥺😫 User 8: Contrasting paint colour on the cupboards. User 9: Use vinyl to cover the cabinets or even just the fridge, easy to stick and also to remove later. Would recommend Jess Rose vinyl!\n",

I know I can just wear it as a shirt if I felt, but aside from that I have no idea what to do and I really want to wear it. Image: a floral bralet with cross straps sitting on a white surface. User 1: If you wear this as a top on its own, I can totally imagine pairing this with a pair of wide legged palazzo pants or any pairs of white pants if you have any - I feel like that’s an easy and effortless way to style it, or a pair of blue light washed jeans that have a regular or looser fit to balance out with how fitted the bralette is.  Just my thoughts, up to you on how you wanna approach it. :) OP: Thanks for the tips! I’m definitely going to take the fitting advice you brought up, that’ll help me with other outfits too.

I already have so many gallery walls in my house, but wanting something different here. Open to paint suggestions too! Image: a room with white walls and a large table and chairs. User 1: Sideboard, mirror and either sconces or a pendant light/chandelier. OP: Would you paint that wall or leave as-is? User 2: What if you went for a bold, mural wallpaper? As an accent wall? User 1: I think that would depend on the rest of the room. Do you want that whole wall to be an accent wall?  It might look odd with the door. User 3: If you go the sideboard route, please make sure you have enough space to open the cabinet doors and for people to walk behind the bench if someone is sitting at the table.   The space looks pretty tight, but it may just be the angle of the photo. User 4: This is the perfect wall for a wall paper accent wall. Peel & stick is the way to go! OP: I thought about that. It’s a bit intimidating. Also what you’re not seeing is the other side of that door is a 2 inch gap to the other wall. Wasn’t sure how hard it would be to wallpaper that little piece User 4: It’s totally manageable! The two inch gap will be annoying but not that bad. Just make sure you use one of those $2 plastic wall paper scraper tool things. I’ve wall papered  much more complicated areas and they always turn out awesome! User 5: That blue orchid is sooooooooo beautiful 😍 I have one myself haha 😄 Are you looking for art or just color ideas for the wall? I have some paintings that may go well with that wall.... I'd be happy to share a rendering of them on the wall if you were looking for that kind of option. No worries if not! OP: Open to art, but no need to spend time on a rendering!  Thanks!! User 6: If you have room, I second the vote for a sideboard with a mirror over top. If there isn't enough depth for the side board, you might also consider doing a very shallow console table to achieve a similar look. OP: Thoughts on color of the sideboard? User 7: Wallpaper accent wall: [URL]  Or a big framed vintage map, vintage travel posters. [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  Maybe add a shelf or shelves.

Do you need more storage? User 11: What’s on other side of the door?    A corner?     I would do a colorful wallpaper here.         Or a paint with a tone on tone stencil pattern. User 3: Two oversized wood poster frames with some black and white photography, line artwork, or fabric inside User 12: One large colorful unframed canvas.  Or framed.  Just something big and that you love to look at! User 13: I don’t think you should put any paintings up but I think you should do like a family picture thing you know the ones that are one frame but you can put lots of separate pictures in because I think that it would just tie the room together\n",

Thank you! User 10: Nice taste. User 9: Thanks! User 11: plenty of plants can survive there. A Peace Lily on a low stand would do well, as would some types of palms.  Just do some research on shade-living plants.  Also, add indirect lighting to that wall, a small lamp in the corner shelf would be good, the top square shelf is ideal for it. User 12: With the cat tower in the foreground, I would recommend against a peace lily. While they're not as toxic to cats as true lilies, they're still mildly toxic and can make your cat sick. User 13: My favorite cat-safe low-light low-maintenance plant is a snake plant.  Lived in my bathroom (with almost 0 light) with once per month waterings (if that).  Even I could keep it alive!! User 12: Yes I have a few snake plants that I forget to water much too often and they thrive in my north facing office. My kitten has also occasionally gnawed on them and had no side effects (though I try really hard to keep him from chewing on plants in general) User 11: I recommend sowing a handful of oats or barley for that.   I bought some overpriced \"cat-grass\" for my wannabe-lion and turns out that it's just barley. User 14: A basket with some blankets would look cute and be functional! :) User 15: An identical bookcase to the one on the other side. Or move your cat tree near the window and put a wall shelf above it for your plant.    Or place an upright storage cabinet or spare chair under the circle User 16: A floor lamp that doesn’t go up high enough to interfere with the art. User 17: Rotan basket User 18: I’d move the art over the tv and put a similar bookcase there User 19: Definitely snake plant. It doesn’t need lot of light User 20: Turntable? User 21: Christmas tree for now? User 22: Honestly, i don't think you need anything there. It's okay to have negative space. User 23: floating shelves with books & fake plants? or small plants on shelves that don't need much light User 24: What if you put the cat tower there and an end table buy the couch and chair User 25: I would love to see the cognac colored chair over there angled toward the couch.

Alovera also does not like direct sunlight believe it or not .   However this drinks carton others mentioned is a strong contender .

User 42: How about a bunch of candles in different sizes or a bunch of candles in glass vases? :) User 43: I agree, three big vases of various sizes. Or two musical instruments to make the detail from the shelf on the other side. User 44: Move the couch out from the wall, move the coffee table further from the couch, move the chair to a space further from both so that it could feasibly look outside, at the couch, or at the TV and now you have a room not necessarily built around watching TV.   Now put whatever you want to the left of your TV and it won't feel like an accessory to your television. A book shelf, shelving of some other sort, an art wall, a floor lamp, a desk, a big plant.  You have a lot of options but damn this room needs to breath a little my dude. Looks like you crammed everything against the wall opposite the tv  Edit: get a bigger carpet in that room and mount your TV either on the wall above the console or on a floor mount above the console and your room will look drastically better User 45: There are lots of plants that can survive with very little light.

(more pics/Floor plan in comments) Image: a long, well - lit apartment hallway features a wood table, a couch, and a black leather chair. User 1: A gigantic piece of art on the couch wall OP: good point. unfortunately we can't hang any nails or paint over the white wall. decals maybe? User 2: You can buy hooks that stick onto walls so you don't have to nail into them. Also, spackle exists. Wall art is what this place needs most imho, so that's a big one.   User 3: If the walls are white you can make nail holes in them and use $5 Spackle and your finger to fill them in when you're done.  Only a trained eye could tell you did anything.   Could also get a wall hanging system [like this]([URL] so the holes would be in the ceiling corners.  If you're worried about holes could always get a [sofa table behind the couch]([URL] and rest artwork on that.  User 4: Is there enough space to switch the living room with the dining area? Pros to switching layout: Gorgeous window view while eating, lots of natural light there, and it will feel more open while you're sitting at the table since you won't be bumping elbows with a big wall; TV wouldn't be against the bedroom wall anymore (better for if you're trying to sleep while someone is using it), reduced TV glare from window. Cons to switching: Couch would be next to entryway, and there would be a walkway right between the TV and seating. User 4: Actually, damn, is that TV unit built in to the wall? OP: unfortunately yes, the TV unit is attached to the wall and can't be moved. Maybe putting the table on the other side of the room (where the plug is)? User 4: I think it depends on what you want to be the first thing you see when you first enter, what you want the overall vibe to be for the whole room, and what kinds of other things you plan on adding. The architectural design in the living room and bedroom is already very sleek and geometric with those sweet windows, rectangular built-ins, and circular columns, but it's not in a way that's overbearing so you can choose to go in a different direction with the styling or to really work with it and play it up.  &#x200B;  Defined, cozy space:  The table on that other wall could definitely work, and putting it there would help to break the room into chunks so that not everything is on the same line of sight. It could help zone the space. If you can't paint the table a lighter color, you'd need to jazz it up in some way to make it more interesting to the eye. With the dark color it is now, it contrasts enough with the wall that it's going to draw attention. You can work with that to make it a good focal point of your entry way by adding something to bring the area more vertical, if that makes sense. Art/decals, tall plant, good lighting... or something. I saw in another comment that you can't put holes in the wall, so you might have to get creative.  &#x200B;  You can polish off that cozy, zoned scheme by adding rugs like u/minimotres suggested, and art above the couch like u/TalkingFromTheToilet said. Think about the colors you might want to incorporate. The couch is going to compete for attention since it's so dark compared to the walls and floor, but if you add more dark things in the area it can balance it out, as well as if you add lighter-colored throws and cushions to break up the block of black.  &#x200B;  Sleek, unified space:  On the flip-side, you can also work with the narrowness of the room and make a space that feels really sleek and modern since you have that huge window, white floors/walls, high ceilings, and a clean-cut monochromatic sofa/TV unit. If you can use that table somewhere else and get a small glass table (or a white glossy one, or a dark one with, again, something above to bring it more vertical), it could bring the whole room up a notch and unify the theme, and *that* type of table could  possibly work on either wall. You'd need different chairs to match.  &#x200B;  Then you could have some sort of long simple-patterned rug tying the dining area to the sofa area, which would guide the eye between the two areas and bring everything together despite how elongated the room is. So you'd have less visual separation between the spaces, but it might work because with a fitting table, you've got a unified theme.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Unrelated edit: That bedspread's gotta go. It doesn't work with the ottoman you have in there, because the ottoman is dark, leathery, and has that classy mature tufting (?), and the pattern and colors on the bedspread kind of clash with that vibe. Try a solid-colored bedspread in a nice material. Experiment with folding your bed-throw in different ways too; you'd be surprised how different that can make a room look. I'd recommend different cushions on the bed too, unless you want to play up the red-pink-white scheme. OP: Awesome, thank you for the comments! Very good points. one of the difficulties I see most is the strong black/white that the place has. The light cushions are definitely something I was looking at, as well as  - a plant (obviously) maybe between TV and window - maybe a floor lamp between couch and window - a rug between tv and couch - not sure about a coffee table. the room feels wider than it looks in the picture (about 3m wide) - having a glass one could still make it feel spacious  And yes, the bed spread and all the tissues etc will go. It was literally the only linen I had, but was thinking to go with neutral slightly patterned sheets ([something like these maybe]([URL] User 4: Yes! Great ideas. Neutral patterned sheets would look excellent here. The ones you linked, or ones like that, would be perfect. They're just interesting enough to be a focal point for the room without being overbearing.  User 5: No it's a tv unit  OP: Additional pictures and floor plan here: [URL] User 6: That looks so SG. OP: correct! User 6: D09? 🤔 OP: East Coast Park actually User 6: 👌👌👌 User 7: Tissues above the bed, nice User 5: U need a couple of area rugs..where did u get that dining chair? OP: yes, definitely one near the couch. maybe a coffee table, or would that take away the \"openness\" of the room?  oh, and the dining chair was already in the house when we got it, same with the dining table User 3: If you like the openness you could get a nesting end/coffee table that stacks and moves easy [like these]([URL] OP: nice, definitely like those! User 8: Is this Miami ?  User 6: It’s the Miami of Asia OP: nope, Singapore actually User 9: Stick on wall paper. It peels off easily when you move. Also, command hooks 😄 User 10: You can get some temporary, easy to lay down fake vynyl \"hardwood\" flooring for pretty cheap I think. User 11: Rug in living room/under dining area.  That looks like an echo chamber.\n",
            "User 116 - dmst8l Original Post: Thoughts on this empty space meant for dining room? Image: a living room with wooden floors, a couch, coffee table and a tv. User 1: Friendly internet advice: get a dining table, even a smallish one.  Good for poker and other games, sit down dinners, desk, project space.  Some of my best memories from hanging out with my guy roomates were at the dining table. OP: That’s a great point! User 2: I think the bookshelf and some wall art would look good. Would there be space for a chair? User 3: A media area or dry bar would work nicely there. OP: Dry bar seems like a solid move User 4: Try a gate leg table? You can put it against the wall and use it as a storage surface but if you have company you can pull it out and sit 6 people around it for a full dinner or a game night.  Hang some nice art above it to help fill the space. User 5: Bar cart! User 6: 2nd bar cart it’s the perfect space for it OP: We use the bar on the left for eating, so we don’t need a dining table. I was originally thinking a chair and bookshelf, but not sure.   Would love some ideas! User 7: A dog User 8: Obvious suggestion would be get a dining table, however I would use that space for a nice chair to read the books I'd put on the bookshelf by the wall. User 9: We just bought [this drop leaf table]([URL] from Wayfair because we didn’t have much space for a dining area, and we love it. Much heavier and sturdier than expected, and the brown we got ended up matching out floors perfectly. Pretty easy for one person to put together too. User 10: Get a bigger sofa. User 11: Air hockey User 12: Spread out your current stuff a little more. You can't enjoy your space if everything is packed as tight as can be. User 13: Bookshelf or a fish tank would look good there! User 14: Unrelated to the question, but what's the ID on those counter stools OP? OP: Got 'em at Target: [URL] User 15: If you dont need a dining table/chair how about a large floor mirror like this one i got from Ikea ([[URL] recently.... add a big plant(s) and maybe a bar cart??

            "User 117 - dmlaj1 Original Post: (23) First time living on my own, I'm also a student. I know it's pretty basic, suggestions? Image: a living room with purple lights and a couch. User 1: Id ditch the douchebag lights from a girl perspective it doesnt look very mature User 2: We need more of these types of comments User 3: From any perspective, really. User 2: youre feelings cant be this hurt by purple leds User 4: I'd suggest removing those lights.  Those are only appropriate in the bedrooms of adolescents, night clubs, and Halloween parties.  A couple of stand lamps with a yellow or white light will make the room more inviting. If you love/need the blue, paint the walls or get a picture to hang. User 5: Great space with a ton of potential.   First off, I wouldn’t cover up that fireplace if I were you. I think it adds a lot of character.   One way I’ve found to add interest to a plain space is to angle the furniture such that it isn’t lined up along the walls like a galley. Here’s an article that discusses how this is used by home stagers: [staging link]([URL]   It’s hard to do in a room like this and still have a walkway to the door, but I think you could angle your tv  (allowing you to show off the fireplace) and match the angle with the couch. If that would put the back of your couch toward the kitchen, you could place a narrow console table behind it.   Then you could have foot traffic to the sliding glass doors on either side. Just an idea. I like moving my furniture around every few months to try different things and get different perspectives on my space.   Also, I would get some more art up on the walls (framed... even plastic frames). I don’t want to pile on too much, but I’m not a fan of either the rope lights or the victory flag. I think you can still showcase what you like, but do so in a mature, elevated way.   Last piece of advice, take all the hand-me-downs you can get. I still have some great stuff I got second-hand when I moved into my first apartment. You could use a few extra pieces like an accent chair, side table and lamps. User 6: This is really good advice. User 7: Get rid of the lights. Looks real tacky, unless you are going for a teenager vibe. User 2: Are you a cannabis plant? Ditch the lights, as others have said. User 8: Tuck in your slipcover so it fits tighter. The looseness looks schlubby. Get a floor lamp with warmer lighting. Honestly I don't mind the blue rope lights because they're hung neatly, but warm light is better for working and reading. Put the W flag in a frame or hang it tighter so you don't see the looseness of the fabric. A snake plant would be a good way to bring some life into the space and they're hardy plants if you don't have a green thumb. An area rug would also look nice but they're expensive so I understand if you want to hold off on that one. Maybe get an arm chair for the left side of the couch too? The POANG from IKEA would be a good option and is cheap, comfortable, and stylish. I'm assuming you're near one because that looks like the LACK coffee table lol. OP: Appreciate the feedback! The couch itself is over 15 years old and this is it's last year of use. The cover honestly doesn't really fit it due to the couch not having the back cushions. Honestly thinking about it, all of my furniture is hand me down, so I have no clue where any of it is from. I do know that the closest IKEA is around 4 hours away, so it's possible! Everything else is very doable, thanks again! User 8: If it has seat cushions, you can still tuck in some of the extra fabric at the back.   No shame in hand me downs! It's a good way to save money for furniture you really like down the road. If you're looking to replace the couch keep an eye on Craigslist. You'd be surprised what people list. You can always rent a uhaul to pick it up. Also, if you're a student and live near campus, people often give away big furniture like that as they're leaving town so see if there are any Facebook groups for that. I got a really nice couch for free when one girl was graduating and couldn't take it cross country with her. User 9: Get a ping pong table and some red solo cups, and you'll be all set! OP: Haha ill start my own frat! User 10: Student? Is the W for the study of wumbology? OP: That's actually my major, so I thought the flag was fitting. User 11: Remove those lights and get a nice standing lamp! Maybe a chair or something else to sit on. User 12: Have an L flag ready. OP: Oh trust me, it didn’t fly much this year. User 13: Looks nice! Maybe a hanging plant? User 14: * Plants do wonders to give a room some more life. I would either put something large in the corner behind the TV (might be a squeeze) or on a shelf above the TV. For the latter you can go with something simple like a [LACK]([URL] and put some plants, books, memorabilia, pretty much whatever. * Putting up proper curtains with a curtain rod that runs all along the wall will help make it less of just a white wall, when it's open you will cover them and add some texture. * I guess getting rid of the carpet is something you can't do, but I get that they're a thing in other countries even though I personally hate them and have never seen them where I live. * The purple lights are a fun thing as a student, but if you want to have a cozier feeling try to have multiple smaller light sources with a more yellow light. A floor lamp next to the couch is an option, something like a [ALÄNG]([URL] would look pretty good and is $40. * To make the TV look less like it's just plopped down next to a wall something like a [LAPPLAND]([URL] is a bit expensive if you're low budget ($150), but it makes it feel more at home and also offers some storage space or room for plants and lights. User 2: Better than mine. Just saying OP: Yeah so the apartment only has a light in the kitchen and the dining area. I don’t have a ton of room for anything more than what’s pictured, a lamp any bigger than a desk lamp would have to be set in an odd spot, hence the TV in front of my fireplace. So at night I either have the aforementioned lights on with the LEDs that everyone hates (I get it, but for now, I dig it) or I just set the LEDs to white and use those as a minimal light source. User 2: Get your boots off the carpet. OP: They usually are, I just got done cleaning them so that's why they're there. User 2: Other than that maybe a small end table with a lamp for the end of the couch 🤙 User 15: Cubs fan eh . OP: Definitely not a cards fan. User 16: Add some wallshelfs! Just stick them on your wall with tape (sticky at both sides) and put a little plant on top User 17: keep it basic. minimalism rocks!\n",
            "User 118 - e6l39z Original Post: Any ideas on how to decorate the space underneath the bed? (Dimension of the spaces is H95xL62xW55 cm) Image: a bunk bed and stairs in a room with hard wood floors. User 1: I would make it into shelving and then add some sort of curtain, like a giant bed skirt, that could cover it up when not in use! User 2: I was thinking storage space too, otherwise it's just wasted space!  Either shelves or some nice big toy boxes (I assume it's a kid's room?) OP: Yep I was thinking about a storage space as well! Unfortunately, I don’t want the room to appear too messy (I like clean and simple) and I’m not nifty enough to build something myself. I was looking at storage boxes but can’t seem to find something that has the perfect size for the dimensions of the space.  And nope it’s not a kid’s room! I want to make the room appear less like a kid’s room too lol. I think painting the bed frame white would help a lot but I actually don’t want to sleep in the paint smell. A friend of mine helped me build this bed to make use of the higher part of the room so I would have more space for other stuff. But it ended up looking like a kiddo’s room ahaha User 3: Could you turn it into a low long book case? Maybe your friend can help create something that works with the existing structure under there. I feel like if you go the painting it white and adding storage will only compound on the looking like a child’s room problem you’re having.  By making it a book case, you can add beautiful coffee table books, some curios or cool-looking, non-childlike things. The bottom “shelf” could be a drawer that pulls out for storage of sheets and such. User 2: Ah okay, my mistake! The bed looks short but perhaps it's just perspective. User 4: Perhaps you could use sheets of plywood to create two sliding doors so you can hide your stuff without ruining the clean lines of the room. User 5: I would put a nice taller plant on the stairs landing to make it more mature User 6: [IKEA Storage Drawers on casters]([URL] Just take a tape measure to IKEA, find this type of style, they have many variants of size/width. Get 3 of them. Has a much more “finished” appearance for adult space, and easily hackable, paintable, different handles etc OP: Thanks! I saw some IKEA hacks when I was looking for inspiration. Really bummed me out that I didn’t know about these hacks before because I would have definitely altered the dimensions of the spaces between the legs of the bed to it. Vice versa is a bit harder lol. User 7: You could use it as a clothing organizer? Attach a pole then hang some stuff. Or you could buy a shoe rack organizer or built your own then put in inside. If you dont like the mess, cover it up with curtain. OP: I quite like this idea! Thanks :) User 8: Related? bc clothes? I have a similar little nook in my room (built-in desk possibly sized for children) and I keep my laundry baskets in it. Keeps my laundry looking neat and pre-sorted which is super useful User 9: Hang icicle Christmas lights and put a mirror on the wall at the back. Would look really cool and give you mellow lightning. OP: Thanks for the suggestion! User 10: If you add a headboard, it will make it look more like an adult's room. User 11: Really surprised not to see bookshelf suggested already.  If you have books this would be the perfect way to display and store them! OP: Yep I was playing with this idea in my head too for one of the sections. The storage space might be a bit too deep for it but I think it would look quite aesthetically pleasing.  Another idea I had was putting a big and two smaller plants within another section.  So many possibilities but I’m scared that it might end up looking really chaotic once it’s executed! User 3: Just now seeing someone else suggested this, too.  A lot of the replies you’re getting are going to look messy or sloppily executed. I wouldn’t rush to a solution on this, especially when you have such a cool raw product here. Make sure it’s done right. I think the book case idea is really solid. I would pay someone for a custom solution for a room like this.  Edit: words User 12: Little tension rod curtains, storage behind. Get some really fun bold fabric, or perhaps a tapestry you can divide into 3 panels. User 13: Rolling carts.  [[URL] User 14: Could you build in drawers? Or closet doors to hide shelving? I can also see classic pull down shades working in a pinch if you wanted to hide things behind. Great space saving idea! User 15: I would paint everything a fresh white (and the walls for a freshen-up) so it looks built-in.   Honestly, I think you guys need to redo the steps to have four of them for safety, going the whole width. It looks dangerous stepping down with no hand rail when you're half asleep in the morning. I'm not kidding. I would faceplant. (And add a handrail on the left!)  You could do two matching dressers/chests or bookshelves on the sides and a tall wicker clothes hamper in the center cubby, or two wicker hampers and one is for laundry, the other for storing out of season clothes and linens. I like the \"plant on the landing\" idea.  Edit: I would also add an interesting sconce or hanging lamps or something. [Idea.]([URL] User 16: Definitely drawers. It would eliminate the need for a full sized dresser. Consider three or even four tiers, with a fourth being for EDC items you want to hide away (keys, wallet, etc). User 17: I’m so sorry! I just assumed! But hey, build a stage or play shop anyway, release your inner child! OP: Hahaha no worries! I found it quite hilarious actually, especially since I already mentioned to some of my friends irl that it looked like a kid’s room. But yep defo going to get to release my inner child! User 17: Get a large screen, console & beanbags instead! You deserve it! User 18: my friend put a drum set under his bed lol User 19: I know you've already said you're not handy at all, but these might give an idea about what might look good, or at least more 'adult'.  Something like these [Scandinavian style drawers]([URL] you can also see how much better it looks without the bumper, as another user mentioned.   You could also get rid of the steps and put in recessed stairs [like this]([URL] (ignore the child, lol).  A cheaper option could be [cabinets like this]([URL] (sorry about the Aussie links, it's just what comes up when I search).  Or shelves [like this]([URL] I found these just by searching for various dimensions that kind of match yours, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find something similar/better.  Your setup really does have the potential to be a beautiful and more grown-up space. Lots of luck! User 20: A couple monsters maybe? User 21: Shelves and then paint everything in the same colour as you paint your wall. This way it will all come together and look more adult. User 22: I immediately thought shelving and drawers! Especially if this is a kid's room! User 23: Maybe put a cabinet door over 1 or 2 sections and convert the remaining to shelving or if you have pets a dog / cat bed or feeding station if you like. User 24: could use are storage or a back board for a desk maybe? User 23: A fort User 23: I had a bed like this! I would put clothing storage under this or just storage in general User 25: hmm storage space idfk User 26: Bookshelves with storage behind. User 27: Maybe a tiny chair in the middle. And shelving on either sides. One for books one for toys User 28: Add cool lights! User 29: I would be cupboard doors on the front and a rail inside and store clothes and shoes User 30: book shelf User 31: That is either a tiny bed or a big room User 17: Depends on the kiddo and their interests. My first thought was sweeping curtains to make a stage for the dramatically inclined, or a counter and a fake shop for pretend play? Yes shelving and cupboards are practical but so is a fun bedroom! OP: Haha unfortunately it’s not a kid’s room! It’s mine and I’m a full grown adult lol. I really wanted to make use of the higher part of the room to save space and a friend of mine helped me build the bed frame. Unfortunately it looks a bit like a kid’s room now and I’m not handy at all so I’m looking for a way to make use of the space underneath without making it look like a mess and also hopefully make the room look less childlike. I have tried looking for storage boxes but haven’t found any with the perfect size. User 32: I hope your prison sentence goes well. OP: Lol thanks! Prison would at least be free\n",
            "User 119 - pbg253 Original Post: [Request] What to do with the picture rail and the wall above it? I love the green but it doesn't sit well against the white. Image: a room with an intricate ceiling and a green wall. User 1: Can we get a picture of the area from a bit more far away? OP: Absolutely, [voila]([URL] User 1: Oh wow that's so fabulously retro.  Are you able to change the green for white? Also I'd fill that space with framed pictures or photographs and turn it into a mini gallery OP: For some reason that green revives me so the whole room will be that colour. The rest of the family aren't that keen but they're willing to overlook it (out the window, haha!). I do like the idea of filling it with imagery, I'm a fan of chinoiserie and would love to stencil on birds and plants, maybe a village scene but that may be pure fantasy.  Actually, I'm a determined fan of [Grayson Perry]([URL] and whish I could create my own homage to his work within those panels, a kind of modern day chinoiserie scene. So instead of villagers collecting water there might be commuters wearing face masks. One project at a time though. User 2: Are you painting the green on the wall? If so I might suggest a more saturated green. That one is a bit washed out. That old style of moulding and picture rail could be left if you chose either a more jewel toned, or pastel green. The one pictured is too much in the middle. By going to either end of the spectrum, the white will be either a subtle accent or a statement look. As it is it's both too much and not enough contrast. User 2: A lighter sage green would work with those curtains(?). OP: Those curtains... those curtains are not staying. User 2: I mean I wasn't going to pass judgement but I can tell you I'm happy to hear that 😂 OP: I know what you mean about the green, but it just so happens to be my happy colour, no idea why. Your evaluation is bang on, it sits just between where you'd want it in term of contrast.  I might spray paint the picture rail gold or add lincrusta panelling with gilding. User 2: To be honest I think that might be a bit overkill with the gold. I would instead find a much brighter cooler white and repaint it. Your gold accents would pop and you'll be able to have your green still. OP: If you could name a bright cool white as a starting point I will bake a gingerbread man and sacrifice him in your honour. User 2: Get baking. Snow day, Oxford white, pure white, and Chantilly lace are some ones to consider. You should be able to order swatches to place next to your green, see if you can get extra large ones too. You'll want something that's not literally perfect white, but not ivory or eggshell. Look for the word \"cool\" in the description. Also check online, most of their websites will have a function to recommend colors that go together. Find the one closest to your green and let it generate the white for you. If you can get the samples you can color match it with your choice of paint at your preferred retailer.   [URL] OP: I think this may be the most economical option. So you're suggesting painting the ceiling, moldings and cornicing in the same white. I never paid much attention to the different shades of white before, but this green makes brilliant white just seem 'undone.' User 2: Not brilliant white but one with a cooler undertone. The green you have Has cooler undertones so the creamier White isn't providing enough contrast. It's making the white look dingy. Using one with a green, blue or grayish undertone as opposed to a pink or yellow undertone with make the green look brighter. A super bright white isn't what you need either. Just cool version instead of yellowy. OP: Ah, I see. Our local paint merchant has a wall of colour swatches, I'll go and take a few to 'measure up.' Thanks for the explanation along with the advise, it shows that good style is more than taste alone. User 3: I love the green. Also this is a truly incredible room. I think a creamy white would look great on top! [Here]([URL] are some good ones! I think the key is getting that cool piece on the ceiling all one creamy white color (or another solid color). User 2: It's already a creamy white and doesn't look spectacular. A Cool white will make it look much more fresh and bright. User 3: [Right, but]([URL] User 2: Very true. My suggestions are mostly based on established color theory rather than opinion though. All paint colors are mixes of others, and the subtle differences resulting in the second and tertiary colors used in them produce the miniscule differences our eyes are able to detect, making things look \"wrong\". The fastest way to make disparate colors look good together is using similar saturation and undertones. If this green had more yellow undertones I 100% would stay with the creamier White. As it is, it used a cooler base in it's mix so a cooler white will make it stand out more. The amount of clarity and saturation of the green also isn't in harmony with this particular white. Check out Maria Killiam. She can explain it much better than I. She teaches a whole class just on shades of white. User 3: Ah yes! That woman wrote the book on making money off of color theory arts schools have taught for a hundred years through the power of registered trademark. If OP likes cool whites, I hope they try that. If not, I hope they like what they pick. I think that’s the thesis that underlies all interior design: is this a place that makes me feel good and safe? Then it’s beautiful User 2: To be fair you don't have to pay her money to get the gist.  And it's a hell of a lot cheaper than art school. *Note I went to art school not her classes. I just found her rhetoric to be helpful discussing color theory with people that haven't taken a class on it. No need to fork over cash to read her blog. But I agree that OP hopefully chooses something that makes her happy. User 3: Can the picture rail just also be that awesome green? OP: Yes, another redditor said the same thing. I never considered it at first but now I'm stroking my chin. User 4: Paint the rest of the wall the same green, paint the ceiling a darker shade of green. Then paint your picture rail gold to match the rest of the smaller trim, but paint the ceiling trim the wall color and the accents on the ceiling the same green as the ceiling. Really make a statement. OP: Oh wow. You don't hold back. That is bold. Especially making the cornicing, or ceiling trim, the same colour as the wall. I'm so used to white ceilings extending down to the picture rail. I'll have to do a bit of research on Pinterest to see how that looks but I like the sound of it. User 4: I normally wouldn't go that bold, but sometimes you have to pay attention to the architecture you have. All of that trim work is asking to be dramatic and glamorous.   You also have to look at what the previous paint was trying to do and what you are trying to do with the room. The old paint is painted this way to make the room look shorter (I'm guessing this is an 8ft ceiling room at least??). The suggestion I gave you will actually make the room look taller.   Also coloring over most of the trim work to match the walls and ceiling will actually help to mute them down and help them blend in with the room. Right now, I feel that they stand out. With the picture rail, if the gold is too bold for you, you could opt to instead paint it the same color as the wall.   Oh and I saw comments to change the green and I wouldn't do sage (not to crap on those responses). Sage is a modern/contemporary color and this is no modern wall. I would stay in the same family of green or darken down to an emerald green/forest green if you feel you need to change it up. OP: That's some really interesting insight and I love how you're taking the character of the property into consideration too. I'm going to save that to my notepad app incase I lose it.  You're right about the height, the walls are about 9-10 ft.  It's stalled at this stage for so long I'm now removing myself from the decision process; that's what's brought me here. Already I'm regretting not finding this sub years ago.\n",

Wedding in a converted barn with a casual lean? Yes. However if they requested formal dress and are holding it in a five star hotel ballroom with a string quartet this would sadly not be appropriate as you'd need a formal.

User 2: Agreed!   What color is it?  Been looking for a similar blue. OP: Thanks, it’s called Denim Drift by Dulux User 1: Something like “Scandinavian Blue” depends on the brand of the color. Probably has no Pantone Equivalent because mostly is a designer color and not a basic one User 3: Personally I would just get some nicer, quality, wooden Venetian blinds. The white slats fit the aesthetic of the room and the feature windows nicely. Curtains may shrink the space a bit and hide the nice window plus you'd probably need custom curtain rails and curtains User 4: No shutters on a bay window is a crime! Granted they are waaaaaaaay more expensive than anything else in terms of window fixings.  Presuming a UK Victorian terrace, it has a ton of potential, I’d get rid of the cream sofa / fireplace OP: Haha good point, but I worry that shutters might block out more light than the current aluminium Venetian blinds? possibly make the room seem a bit smaller... but no more than curtains I suppose. I will have a good think about that.   I think the main reason I’m thinking curtains, is because they’ll block out the light from the back of the TV (it’s one of those Phillips Ambilight TVs). Currently even with the blinds closed it looks like I’m having an full on rave from the outside when it’s dark! I think curtains might offer a bit more privacy in that regard. Also hopefully curtains would help to keep the house warm in the colder months.  You are right, UK house, early 1900s.  The cream sofa and fireplace both came with the house, I do need to replace those eventually! User 5: [My old lounge]([URL] looked very much like yours. I got shutters, but cafe style ones so only up to the window opening. I wasn't overlooked, but I think you have windows on the opposite side of the road that could see in with that style so maybe best to go all the way up.   They don't block as much light as you'd think. If you're south facing and get the sun shining through the window you can angle the shutters so all the light reflects off them and hits the ceiling - lovely and bright, but also with privacy. It didn't work out too much more expensive than a really nice pair of curtains and curtain rail.  Regarding the ambilight I think you'll always struggle with it in that position as you have multiple different surfaces behind it. It's most effective on a single colour wall, which you can probably get in the alcove, but would limit the size of TV you can have. I'm sure you probably know that 😊 User 4: If you get wide Louvre shutters, they’ll block less light than Venetians usually because you don’t have so many and no string / tape mechanism. You can also completely open shutters User 6: Some would say shutters on a bay window are a crime :) to each their own! User 7: Try blinds that raise from the bottom to the top. You're street level, so you can have privacy with the top third to half of the windows open. Then I wouldn't cover the top of the window with a curtain. User 8: No curtains. Just invest in some really nice wooden blinds.   Also, what paint/color did you use? It’s lovely. I want to do something like that on the landing above my open living room, with a charcoal blue on the wall in front of it. OP: Thanks, definitely going to look into some nice wooden blinds.   The paint on the accent walls is called Denim Drift by Dulux User 8: Thank you so much! User 9: no curtains, leave as it is User 10: White User 11: Linen in a dark mustard color! User 12: yup my first though but i think nicer blinds is the better option User 13: I thought mustard too. User 14: I agree with /u/the-stoned-astronaut about wooden blinds.  If you're in the UK  try [these people]([URL] for good prices/quality.  No connection here except as a customer.  I've probably had 30 blinds from them over two houses, wooden venetians and romans.  I would say their customer service has got a lot dodgier over the pandemic but the deliveries seem to work in spite of that.  As long as you don't need help from Customer Services it'll be fine.  Also worth noting their SizeSure guarantee.  I fucked up the measurements on one roman blind and they replaced it no questions asked.  Didn't have to return the original so no faffing about. User 15: I'm willing to bet this flat is in Glasgow judging by the layout, so I would suggest a nice trendy set of steel bars User 16: white long curtains with some yellow tint or design on it would look flawless User 17: Depending on your personality, a nice color pop could suit the room well. User 18: Bright orange or marroon User 19: I would go with cream or black. As much as I like the wall color you've selected, I like a bit of contrast in the curtains. So I'd match with either the couch/chair/fireplace color or the television/tv stand/endtable. Although with the plants you could use like a Hunter Green and it would work as well. User 20: Teal. Looks like there's some in the rug to tie it in User 21: I agree with tea stains on the corner User 13: White. Silky-smooth linen. Martha Stewart has some lovely inexpensive ones.

User 1: You should make sure that your apartment complex is happy for you to decorate the external area. Many complexes deem anything outside to be a fire hazard. OP: I checked with the management :) decor is allowed so long as it is appropriate. User 2: You are lucky! We're allowed a mat and that's it. No wreaths, though people still do.   I would put in an umbrella stand under your door number. Who wants dripping wet umbrellas inside? It's the perfect space for something tall and skinny too.   Also agree bigger wreaths are better. User 3: Not sure it this something that may get taken but here are a few suggestions for the floor space under your number plate:  - Lantern (multi sizes maybe)   - Broom (aldi's sells a cinnamon one around fall)  - Large vase / jug with seasonal floral  - Small wooden crate (one or two stacked; top with pumpkin?)  - Pumkin (s) User 4: Trader Joe's has the cinnamon brooms too! User 5: Please don’t do a cinnamon broom in an apartment hallway. It’s a migraine trigger for a lot of people! User 6: The wreath could be bigger. User 7: Put a big \"no soliciting\" sign on the wall to the left. Then put a \"beware of dog\" under that. User 8: Maybe even a \"come back with a warrant\" or \"we don't call the cops\" for extra flair. All within the pumpkin spice fall color palette, of course. User 9: One I recently saw in my town: \"Trespassers will be shot. Survivors will be shot again.\"  Very welcoming.

I wouldn’t normally gravitate to burlap, but the wreath is big and lush and warmed up my white door pretty nicely. Wreaths can also be expensive, so having a default is cost effective and an easy choice. OP: I appreciate your input :) this is my first place and I didn't realize how expensive decor can be- especially wreaths! I love your burlap idea User 20: Hey, I think a side table ranging 18 to 20 inches high just at the left corner may look good. You can also place a small flower plant over it which will look better.  Let me know if you might need some handmade handcrafted wooden end tables or side table suggestions. OP: Hey guys! Decorating the outside of my apartment.

            "User 123 - dem8ai Original Post: Need help with a paint color choice! Should I do another coat of this peachy neutral, or do something a little lighter (closer to white?) I’m going for a boho vibe with pops of rich color and I have one wall that’s all natural wood! Image: a bedroom with a window on one wall and wood wall paneling on the other side of the wall. User 1: I think the color looks nice from this one picture, but admittedly I'd probably feel differently if it was my own space, and if it was a small room with not a lot of natural light. I think a bigger contrast between the gorgeous wood wall and the other three walls would be fantastic.   The thing about white paint is that it REALLY opens up and brightens a room. My thing with beige and peach tones in a darker room is that after a while I start to wonder why I chose bandaid colored paint. But that's a personal thing. It can be really lovely and cozy and minimalist if done right, and it does sound like you know what you're doing with that color scheme. I love colorful rooms in general, but the house I live in right now is pretty dark, and after choosing to paint my living room white I couldn't be happier. It made such an enormous difference in the brightness and overall feel of the room. And colors can always be added in as accents. I've got a lot of green plants, wall art, and throw pillows.   What it really comes down to is the style you want. If you paint it white, I see more of a bohemian or Scandinavian influenced design, but with peach walls I see chunky throw blankets and string lights. Both colors will look good with wood accents and sharp lines. OP: Thank you so much for this!! I totally agree - something was bugging me about the color and now you’ve totally nailed it, it’s bandaid beige 🤣 it was actually an old gallon I had laying around the house so I’m not losing any money going with a new color!  In your opinion, should I do more of a bright, pure white (like the ceilings?) There’s also white trim around the room that I’ll be painting over, so I wasn’t sure I should completely match the two. I was thinking something like this:  [URL]  But now I’m worried it’s a little too beige as well. Any input is much appreciated!! Thanks again! :) User 2: Maybe you could do a tinted white so it's not stark white walls on stark white trim? My roommate and I just painted parts of our house this color   [URL] The online swatch doesn't do it any Justice tbh. In person the walls have light blue  or lilac  tint depending on how the light hits it. The baseboards stand out from the walls giving it a Morocco vibe, which goes with the boho aesthetics. It's still fairly white, so it's not overwhelming either.  Obviously you don't have to go with this exact color. OP: Ooooh, I like that color! Definitely going to add it to a list with a few more options to sample out on the wall. Updates to come :) thanks all for the help!! User 3: I’m not a huge fan of wood tones and browns to begin with. I think they get outdated really quickly.   Besides that, too much in a small room is going to be dark and make the small room look even smaller.   If it were me, I would paint that wall white. I’d also get white shelves instead of more dark anything. Brighter will make the room feel larger. OP: I totally agree! I wanted to paint the wood wall white originally and go with a color, but the parents won’t let me so I’m stuck hahah. I’m thinking of doing a bright white like you said and just accessorizing with some small plants that won’t take up the space! User 4: I thinkt that would probably be your best bet at making the room feel bigger too. Then you can add all your color in bright accessories and plants! User 3: I understand completely! Plants will help. The white wall will help. There are a lot of white plant pots that mount on the walls on Amazon. Maybe Mom and Dad will allow those on the wood walls?    Maybe keep big things like furniture white and add colorful accessories. OP: There actually are already two hideous wood shelves on the wood wall that I’m taking down and I have to put something up in their place since they’re going to leave some damage! They’re cut off in the picture but I think they’d be the perfect spot for some white shelves or plant pots. I’ll definitely post an update :) thanks for your help! User 3: You could chalk paint them white if their shape is acceptable. Can you add some other images of the room? You might get more suggestions and help.  I look forward to seeing your update! User 5: Personally, I’d go with a nice, bright white for the wall. Maybe a yellow curtain on either side of the window, but put the rod all the way up next to the ceiling.  How big is the room? OP: That sounds like a good idea! Big fan of yellow so I’m down. I don’t have the exact dimensions, but it’s just about big enough for a full bed on the wood wall with a small nightstand on either side. There’s just one more window on the opposite wall (not pictured here). User 6: Where will the pops of rich color come from if you’re planning on going with white or beige walls? I personally like bold color choices for paint. I recently painted a small room in my house blue, which is basically the same shade blue as painters tape. It sounds awful, but it looks really great with the natural wood moulding, blinds and floor. The ceiling is white. It might be fun to paint one wall a rich shade of your favorite color and paint the other walls white. If you do go with a bold color, be sure to get the paint from a paint store such as Sherwin Williams or Benjamin Moore. Their paints are more durable than paints sold at non-paint stores. OP: For reference, the room is super small. I have a beige fabric bed and headboard that’ll be centered on the wood wall with some floating shelves (either gold or black) and I want to incorporate some rich velvet colors, like deep greens, blues and reds! Maybe a vibrant rug for that pop of color?  I’m leaning towards an off white color for the paint rather than the color I have now - any recommendations? TIA! :) User 7: Somthing peachy/ pink might be nice User 8: I would go for a bright WARM white.   I actually am digging the wood wall.   If you’re looking for inspiration I highly recommend going to apartmenttherapy.com and putting ‘Melbourne’ in the search bar. I find nearly all of the posts from there are bright boho with pops of colour.\n",

Also I’ve seen different ways of stacking books that look really visually appealing (like sorted by color or in small horizontal stacks) that might help. User 5: I’d take out one or two shelves so you can space them remaining further apart. Then you could place larger objects on it.  Maybe put some cool patterned peek and stick wallpaper on the back and paint the rest a coordinating color. User 6: You can buy ceramic decorative items from a thrift store and spray paint them all the same color User 7: Mason jars where every time you open a bottle of wine, the cork goes in the mason jar.  Start with 3 or 4 and fill those bad boys up!  That only fills up half a shelf but it's still half a shelf.

I mean I started looking here but you've got so many options, it depends on your budget and current surrounding style and taste. Three examples [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  I think it's imperative that you get a rug for under set too. If you're not on a budget I'd just get a new table too or you could sand that one back for a more natural look which will update it. User 6: Consider rearranging things on the bookshelf. I think it would look good to alternate shelves of books vs shelves of decorations. It also is a good idea to put them in some sort of order, maybe a range of color or height, and all standing up. You could use one of the vases as a centerpiece for the table as well. And as someone else said, center it behind the table User 7: A colorful center piece would help too User 8: You might want to add some accents on your chair like having this one [[URL] plus accompany it wall decors on the side like having a [3 panel blue wall art]([URL] and just an opinion also, I think you need to invest also on your shelves OP: Wow I didn't know those accents existed!

Looks like it could ruin the furniture, so get performance fabrics.   Your bank account won’t thank me, but this exceptional space deserves a very good quality rug in a natural fiber. Either classic or modern would work with the room, just make sure that the rug is enough of a neutral colour that it won’t overwhelm. Also, make sure the rug is big enough for the room,-many people buy rugs that are too small for the room-which is why I recommend shopping in person with an experienced rug dealer.   If you’re not interested in a project and just want something to cover the floor, then just get a big, off white rug.

User 2: I agree with this, you should stick with that navy blue or one of the greens so it looks like one whole set, but you could probably get away with going for one of the other colors of the skirt like that pink/red it just might make you look more Christmasy.

Will do User 5: Deep tan suit, pale sage green shirt, dusty rose tie. Brown shoes. User 6: A blue suit, like a denim blue color, a cream shirt and a salmon pink bow tie. User 7:  Nice chocolate brown with sage green bow tie and pocket square. User 8: Gray suit with a pink tie/bowtie and brown/tan shoes User 9: Blue or gray suit. Gray suit has the light blue accents of the dress and gray or black shoes. Or do a blue/navy suit with gray or pink accents. I'm personally not a fan of the gray with pink but that's an opinion (if you like it and can rock it go for it).   If you go to get a suit you might be able to bring the dress in with wherever you go (provided there's permission from your gf) so you can match the colors. Tailor/employee will help you as well. With spring, grays, blues and pinks are legit perfect so this dress is lovely please tell her!  If you do a corsage and boutonniere, I would go for matching the blues and to do some white with very small amounts of pink. Off set the color balance of the dress.  Have fun!!\n",

What other colors would look good here? Painting the wall is an option too. Image: a couch sitting in front of a brown and white rug. User 1: I think greens will contrast the pinkish/ terracotta color of the rug nicely. User 2: Pale sagey green. And please don’t not get rid of the rug!! It’s gorgeous! OP: Thank you! I had the couch already and then the rug fell in my lap so now I’m trying to design around it! I love it too! User 3: 100 percent green. Drab would look lovely. Maroon too. User 4: Add some dark green for sure! Either wall or accents in pillows or blankets. User 5: You could add greens, blues, or purples as well. User 6: Everything is neutral. You need some color. Rich purple would be my choice. User 7: Darker sage-y greens and pull that dusty terra cotta orange from the rug.     I think your wall color is fine, you just need some things on the wall, and maybe some throw pillows.     Slate/ gunmetal rather than brushed nickel or black.   Darker greys are softer, warmer, not as sharp.       Dark clear stained woods. OP: Thank you! User 8: Dark blue. White molding. User 9: Navy. Deep blue to offset the lighter colors. For woods, go with a dark oak or \"milk chocolate\" colors. OP: Thanks so much.

User 1: Having a long line of stuff on the wall facing the bed is stressful looking.  So move stuff around so that wall looks less cluttered and junky.  Move your sneakers somewhere else. Hang them in shoe rack behind closet door or in a bin under the bed but get that clutter hidden and out of view.  For now I’d try the book shelf between the windows? Will it fit there?  Or move the tall mirror there?  Perhaps get rid of bookshelf or that storage thing?  Not sure what will work in your space but move stuff around so that wall is not just random collection of clutter and mess? OP: Great advice, thank you! Moved the shelves between the windows, storage (laundry bin) and sneakers into the closet.  Looks a lot better User 1: Will you post an updated picture? Then we can give suggestions for next round of improvements?  I’m thinking you should center the dresser with the bed. Perhaps find cool way to hang your skateboards above the dresser as both storage and decor? OP: [[URL] (updated) - obviously different lighting because - later.  They're snowboards.  I could also potentially hang them in the hallway going to the room (long corridor).  I do like having them out User 1: Definitely looks better. So I’d find something to hang above the dresser. Good art or bunch of photos or round mirror so think of something there.  Or on the now big empty wall. A photo gallery wall making sure to have some touches of blue to tie into your bed would look great.  I’d also think of getting rid of floor shelf lamp. Replace with matching or close to matching nightstand and lamp to better balance out the room.  Yes use your snowboards and find way to feature them. They are cool and would add person to the room.  What is on other side of dresser tucked away? OP: Its box of clothes that i'm getting rid of not permanent.  I'm trying to figure out what kind of art to hang. It feels like a big blank wall, and tough to consider what to put there. User 1: Go on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist in your area. See if there’s anything you like. And keep checking and I’m sure you’ll find something.  Sometimes it’s much easier to say yes or now rather than go through a big search to figure out what you want. User 2: Headboard for the bed, big rug that goes partly under the bed and artwork between the windows and on the right hand wall. OP: Any recs for headboard material? Rug color?  I guess the only thing not replaceable is the dresser, User 2: A dark wood to match your dresser would look really good especially with the dark blue bedding. I personally wouldn’t go for a fabric headboard as they can mark and wear down far faster than wood/ metal. User 2: Don’t go for a rug with too much white as it looks dirty if you’re walking over it a lot. A pattered rug of different blues, blacks and whites would be nice to add some interest to the space. User 3: What's your budget?  Totally agree with other poster, I think you have too much *stuff* visible that it makes it look cluttered and busy.   I would do a low and wide credenza/dresser across from the bed, and hide all the stuff. [Dresser]([URL] if you need more clothes storage, something like [this]([URL] to hide shoes and other stuff.  The bookshelf can go on the wall with the bed\n",

User 1: my shower curtain is nearly the same as your tapestry haha User 2: Colorful prints, some rich drapes with swags, and plants with large leaves. OP: I do have a pot with a dead plant from my roommate and we haven’t decided which plant to get that has big leaves. What color of drapes would be a good choice for this room? User 2: Something with a bold jewel tone. Your room is so pale that it’s washing out the earth tones, and so you need something like a royal blue, maroon, burgundy, forest green, or goldenrod yellow to bring color back into the room in a masculine-leaning way. OP: I will definitely look into a royal blue. Would bright or light purple be good or no? User 2: I’d use royal purple or something in the plum family. The bright purple might be a little shocking against those earth tones and that magnolia paint.  That being said, it’s up to you to determine what colors work or don’t in your space. User 3: I think that tapestry would much better if it was pulled super tight to fit the space between the doors.  Use a bunch of flat white tacks. OP: Unfortunately it’s about 2 1/2 inches shorter than the doorway to doorway length. The top is pulled tight but the bottom hangs and I still need to steam away the fold lines from moving. User 2: Maybe build a wood framework for it? Make it seem like a huge canvas print? OP: I never thought of that! That actually would look awesome. Thinking like a dark cherry? User 2: Or a medium walnut, both would look nice in the space. User 3: Yeah, either use a blue-grey from the tapestry, or choose a contrasting color. User 4: You can buy some wallpaper that looks pretty much identical to that cool tapestry you have on the wall User 5: dont put a rug on a carpet.  :)\n",

User 1: I haven’t had my wedding yet so I can’t speak from experience, but style-wise, I don’t think you can go wrong here! Your dress has beautiful detail at the top so a full updo wouldn’t make it plain at all. The straps are also thin enough that wearing your hair all the way or half down would look beautiful as well. Does your hair hold styles like curls very well? Do you plan on dancing and moving around a lot on the big day? If your hair doesn’t stay curled and you plan on doing things that might make you sweaty, an updo would be more practical. Do you wear your hair in a bun normally? I forget what youtuber it was, but someone recommended to have a more glamorous version of your go-to hairstyle on your wedding day. You’ll feel practical and familiar but beautiful. OP: Need help with how to do my hair with this dress. I have long-ish thick hair that goes to about the middle of my back, no bangs or anything. Dress is Maggie Sottero Charlene.  Wedding is in June so I wondered if it would be better to have an updo to avoid having all my hair down on my neck/back and being hot. It also seems more practical to not have to worry about touching/adjusting an updo like I would with long hair. Also my hair tends to frizz I humidity, so that's another worry of having it down/half up half down. I do like the half up half down styles but like I said, not sure it would be practical or end up actually looking good.  Will my shoulders/back look too bare with an updo and all my hair up? Or would it cover up too much of the dress to have it all down? I've also seen a lot of updos have \"pieces\" pulled out (face framing?) Which I think look odd especially on me as I don't have short layers or bangs.  I'd love to incorporate some type of braid (even small ones/hidden) but again, not sure if this would be the same concern as leaving my hair down.  Has anyone had summer weddings with hair down and regretted it/how it looked afterward? I'm so stuck on what to do! User 2: Down and wavy! Then later in the evening you can throw it up in a loose pony if you want User 3: Hair up. It’s cooler, will keep you looking fresh.  Will also elongate you. Seems to go with the dress. User 4: beautiful! i vote hair up. sounds like you have long hair, which would make for a gorgeous updo, and you won't have to think about it at all.\n",
            "User 138 - vqrpoc Original Post: Any tips on what I can do for this space? I feel like the carpet really limits me. Image: a living room with a couch, coffee table, tv and shelves in it. User 1: You could always buy an area rug to put over portion of it. User 2: Don’t let the carpet bother you. Get a fun shag or patterned rug for the sofa area (at least 8x10, not too small!) User 3: Rugs.com is having a big sale right now and they have cute stuff. User 4: I’ve found that boutiquerugs.com is fair as well User 5: The carpet is definitely stealing the show in this room right now, which is probably pretty frustrating especially if you don't love forest green.  But, don't despair! There are definitely ways to help balance the green and give a more complimentary look.  A few things that might help:  - Get Retro. Look for inspiration from time periods where forest green would have been trendy colours, like the Mid Century Modern trend.  - Match Jewel for Jewel. Select another jewel tone (or two) that will help balance and compliment the green. Warm tones like red, pink, purple, orange and yellow are all good bets.  - Light Well. Lighting is always good for mood setting, so take a look at floor lamps, wall sconces, etc, to help brighten the space.  As others said, you can also definitely layer an area rug over top of the carpet. It can help define the living space and you can use it to tie the other jewel tones into the room as well.  Have fun! Sometimes having something tricky to work with can make the design experience more fun. User 6: Warm lighting might even make the floor look less green by cancelling it out a bit.  I’d experiment with that some if possible User 7: Personally, I would lean into the carpet if you can't get rid of it. This gives me a forest fairy/cottage core vibe or you could pull off a midcentury modern look. The coffee table already fits, you can buy legs to put on your couch to match it. Get some more atomic looking decor/art and a retro lamp User 8: I was just going to say they should embrace the carpet and put some mcm decor in the room! User 9: I agree, embrace it if you can’t change it! I have a dark green tile in one of my bathrooms. I ended up doing a peel and stick wallpaper that was jungle/leaf themed and doing gold accents. It’s one of my favorite room transformations in the house now lol. I can’t stop suggesting Nuwallpaper, they offer a lot of patterns and have high quality wallpaper that doesn’t peel but it also doesn’t damage the wall at all when removed. The right wallpaper can set the course of your room even if it’s just an accent wall. User 10: I hate carpet and looooove this carpet!! You definitely can make this room very cool. I would go very light warm tone furniture and decor - like beige, whites and natural woods. Look into tiki aesthetic like rattan, bold artwork. Task lighting is going to be inportant so don't skimp. I woukd go with a very narrow cteam color palate and natural wood. It will look amazing. User 11: Get a really large jute rug to put on top of the carpet and neutralize it as much as possible.  Like an 8x10 rug  Your friend has shared a link to a Home Depot product they think you would be interested in seeing.    [URL] User 12: Get some pool ball bean bag chairs.  (Kidding, but also not kidding) User 13: You want the art nouveau look. You've already got the carpet, the ceiling fan, and the wood furniture. Get a lot of fancy looking lamps, change the curtains, be more deliberate about the things you hang on the walls and bring some of that furniture away from the walls and into the room. User 3: Install a curtain rod that's long & high enough to cover the sliding door blinds. Then get some patterned curtains that can compete with the carpet & create some visual interest.  ETA: The tapsetry would look nicer framed. You can make a cheap frame by adhering the tapestry to foam backer board with spray adhesive, and then make a wood frame with [moulding like this]([URL] to go over it. Home Depot will do cuts if you bring measurements. Wood glue should be sufficient to join the wood. User 14: Yup, that green carpet really stands out. Only way to settle it is to make it look like an indoor forest! Put down a rug that looks like a creek with stones. Tack fabric to the walls that look like trees and vines. Or mountain scenery! Freestanding lamps that have flower blossoms around the lights, tables that look like red mushrooms, mushroom pillows, use antlers for decoration, stone inlay desk, tree stump and log decorations. The fabric you already have up is the right idea.  Go all in! User 15: Gotta rearrange the double layer couch. I’d also move that table with the box fan on it, the way it is, it’s blocking off the room. User 16: Get a large area rug! User 17: some plants and greenery might compliment the carpet well. then for stuff on the walls im thinking incorporate darker shades of yellow, muted coral colors User 18: Putting green? That’s pretty bad, lol. I think an area rug or 2 is your best bet User 19: Velvet furniture in emerald/navy would be perfect. User 20: I would totally layer some area rugs in here, then you could just have green carpet peeking through as an accent color!   You can often find nice inexpensive rugs thrifting or even buy some cool carpet remnants from a carpeting place and add some backing where needed.  I can’t really tell how high the pile is on this carpet but if you don’t mind a real cushiony floor you could do it even if it’s a deep carpet, just make sure to occasionally lift rugs with furniture sitting on top or in high traffic areas and give it a vacuum every so often to keep it fluffed up User 21: Pink and green are great together. ❤️ User 22: The room is a bit dark feeling. I love the color of the green, but definitely break it up with a lighter colored rug.  Add some lamps, a couple accent colors that will go with the green. (I like terracotta with dark green). Put some lighter colored artwork up. The dark art against the dark carpet and dark couch is a bit much imo User 23: Yup, too dark but not in a good way (there are dark black/blue or green rooms that are absolutely stunning). I like the carpet though, it gives a lot of room to play with decor. If op can get rid of something that would be the two dark wood bookshelves / stands on the right. They look outdated/out of place and makes the space overloaded. Sofa and light wood table seem ok. This space has a lot of potential and pretty sure will be easily improved softening the colour palette and adding some cool items. I do suggest using natural materials (like light coloured rattan / bamboo) and adding golden / framboise touches for a happy finished look User 24: Carpet lowkey coolest thing here, would maybe lean into the green and what happens there instead :) User 25: I know this is a boring suggestion but a large cream rug with some kind of patten would work well here. User 26: For the carpet if you can't afford to redo the floor you might be able to take a few area rugs and cut them up like best dressed does in this video: [URL] User 27: yellow looks good with green. velvet too. maybe aim to get matching shades of wood, curtains, and either a brighter couch or bright throw pillows n blankets for that couch. decluttering would really help and fixing the droop in the wall decor blanket  edit also warm lamps User 28: I would lean into a 70s vibe, peel and stick contact paper. Bright orange couch cover.. funky 70s crap everywhere lol User 29: I don't know if anyone here believes in Feng Sui but the color of that rug is stressing me out. It's too much of a strong color for a rug. If you can't replace it I agree with the others about getting an area rug to cover most of it.  Good luck! User 30: Removing the carpet is easy, if u aren’t renting. Just pull up a corner to see what the subfloors are made of and if it’s good wood you can turn it into a wood floor space, if it’s not good add some paint!   Or some nice area rugs could be a smarter choice, too User 31: I’d lean into the green and put up some of that peel-off wallpaper stuff in a leaf print as an accent wall. User 32: I think if you work with the carpet instead of against it you’ll see great results.  First of all, if you can, I’d get a lighter couch. If not, a white throw blanket.   I think the darker wood of the bookshelf looks really nice with the carpet. Maybe a coffee table in the same wood.  Framing your artwork is cheap and easy and will really pull it together and make it feel more polished! User 33: Putting green User 34: Paint the ceiling lighter blue  , draw your eye away from the green User 35: i LOVE the carpet! sure, on its own it feels kind of “heavy” but you can brighten up the space for sure! area rugs that add pops to the floor itself, depending on your budget maybe some more “funky” furniture and decor. not sure if you would be down to commit slightly to a plant, but adding some snake plants would be a nice way to fill up some of the lower wall space. if you find a good sized one, they don’t need much attention besides lots of water every once in a while (and some kind words here and there 😋)   again, i’m not sure what your situation is like so if this isn’t an option forgive me! but changing the ceiling fan could make a HUGE difference. even just painting it to add some personality. i would maybe move some furniture around so it feels more open, but of course i’m not sure what the dynamics of the room are so if this is what makes the most sense keep this overall layout.   another thing that my brother and sister in law do in their upstairs space (the “game room” / brothers computer area / shmoking room 😶‍🌫️) is pinning tapestries along the ceiling. the lights are SO bright with the white ceiling up there, the tapestries sound like they would look awful but in my opinion it added a lot of personality, and also made the room feel much more cozy and “home” like. User 36: Go minimalist. Get rid of accessories/ decor. Add jewel tones accents or natural accents. Keep it simple User 37: I like the movie room vibe, but if you put the white couch where the dresser thing was so that you had kind of a conversational pit? Can we have some more pictures User 38: Move from white walls to cream and then start incorporating things with brass.   Look at this picture for color scheme inspo    [URL] User 38: The white in my pic looks white but it’s definitely cream User 39: Maybe use the green to your advantage? The green could be fake grass and you could somehow turn the floor into a “field” of flowers or something? Put a mural of a tree on your wall or lots of plants and flower in pots…I know it’s not the answer you want but I would try to incorporate the color somehow.  If that idea isn’t to your liking I agree that an area rug or two would help. User 40: The carpet is strange but I kinda like it.you can tell it's clean and it reminds me of a pool table :) User 41: I’d get a rug or some pillows that compliment the rug and also get warmer/cozier lighting. User 42: Anything that has to go with golf would go good in there User 43: Oh honey I’m sorry but it makes me want to book a tee time. I would use a neutral colored room size rug. Nothing with brown in it because it will then look like grass AND dirt. User 44: Is there another sofa behind the sectional? User 45: Seems like light is lacking… I’d get a big mirror to lean against a wall to increase the feeling of light in the room.   An area rug, for sure. Maybe something light in color with green accents in it?  Potentially matching colored slip covers (light color) for the couches. The room just feels dark to me so I want to brighten it up.   Cute throw pillows for the couches.   Look at Target and TJ Maxx/Home Goods/Marshall’s/At Home/IKEA.  The dark wood furniture may not look too bad if you go with lighter fabrics on your couches, throw pillows, and area rug. Otherwise, the dark wood feels outdated. User 46: my favorite part about decorating is adding a bunch of small lil items to the area, like candles, books, vases, etc! User 47: The carpet is literally the best thing about this room. User 48: Mini putt putt course.\n",

User 1: I like the rug and the mix of vintage and kinda modern look of the space.   Unsolicited suggestions though 😅.    - I would mount the tv on the wall and put a plant on top of the console and some ornament ( that globe on your great looking coffee table, books, etc.)   - I would change the curtain to a longer one and a pair ( I’m not quite sure about it but I can see it working on the space) I think it will make an illusion that you have a bigger window and would also hide the cord.   - I would also put a floor lamp beside the art piece so that it accentuates that area, especially, that it has a big wall post there.   - I love a room with a plant or two, so putting another one beside the sofa would look good and maybe also on the coffee table. 😉  Overall, the space is looking great. Def, something that I would prefer living in. I like the aesthetics of the floor, the open brick wall, and the revealed tubing below the ceiling. 👍🏻 OP: thank you so much for your advice! lots of ideas i wouldn’t have considered on my own! i like the idea of mounting the tv, it’ll be a fun project! User 1: You’re welcome! It’s always fun to recreate a space that is your own. It’s even more fulfilling doing it yourself.   Good luck on making it a more comfortable space for you! User 2: I’d suggest finding a way to hide the cord on the wall near the window, and something to fill the space over your tv (like a bright piece of art) would look rad OP: haha yeah i definitely need a power strip. and thanks for the second artwork idea, i never thought about about that! User 3: There's something really off about that curtain, it looks like a shower curtain.  I'd figure out a different window solution. User 4: To maximize space (or the appearance of it), id say look into mounting the TV, adding some light/white coloured accents (I.e. sofa cushions, throw blankets, Art, books, shelves, whatever), and in the longer term, go in the same direction with your tables and tv units User 5: Agreed about the curtains. You should aim for them to skim or touch the floor with about an inch of fabric. Your ceilings look like they might be pretty high, but you can find panels that are 96 or 108 inches without too much trouble! User 6: This room has a lot of potential! Just throwing a few ideas out there:  If you're able to paint, I'd paint the brick wall a very light grey while leaving the column white. This would add a little contrast to the room and would compliment the pops of color you have even more. The wall behind your TV I'd paint a bright white and as another poster recommended, I'd try mounting the TV and place some accent shelves.  I absolutely adore the design of the curtain, but unfortunately for me it feels far too short. I'd go with a length that hits just about floor level as it'll define that corner of the room and make it cozier while also hiding the outlet cords.  I'd also love to see a hanging plant or perhaps some lights from that incredible black pipe/beam.  These are just some random ideas, but I'm excited for you regardless of what you choose to do. :) User 7: I love your rug and it's nice that you've got a different shade if pillow, you might want to add some wall art in here which is like something like [this]([URL] and by the way you might be planning to have a floor-length curtain and some plants in here\n",
            "User 141 - fk62wc Original Post: Buying a Victorian end of terrace in UK, looking to renovate it very mutually for resale-ability what would you do with this lounge? fireplace will be taken out of course. m = 4.32m bay x 3.58m recess (14'2\" bay x 11'8\" ) Image: a room with a fire place, red curtains, and a mirror. User 1: Remove wallpaper, paint a pale neutral, keep drapery, replace flooring with something mid-tone neutral (ideally hardwood, deep walnut brown stain), paint fireplace mantle white. OP: Thanks! What do you think in regards to the fireplace? I was thinking of buying an iron cast Victorian fireplace and fitting it in the space as I think it would match the nice hardwood floors eventually, or what would you do with the fireplace ? User 1: Would it be possible for you to post a close up of that tan surround material? Can't tell if it's stone or what...? Would retiling it, and the hearthstone, be possible? Can you replace the electric unit with something more attractive, like a glass-front one? The Victorian idea might work, but it can look corny or cheap if not done well.  I'm making these suggestions for resale, but also i feel you have a lovely room and too many elaborate \"improvements\" would wreck the feel of it, whether you sell or not! OP: Sadly no close up but hopefully will be in my hands within 3 weeks or so...  I would rip all of that out and maybe keep the wooden frame around it but the Victorian fireplace would fit in the space perfectly as that is what would of been originally there before the boiler fireplace.  Appreciate your input!   Also what colours would you go for have any in mind? User 1: Yes, maybe keep the wooden surround. If the floors get changed to dark walnut stain, I’d match it to that. White or pale tiles perhaps for for stone surround and hearthstone too.  The drapes are the right length, and they look nice from here...velvet? That would certainly set a tone.  Walls could be just a simple Bone or off-white. Not sure what colors are called in UK, and what paint companies. But if for resale, don’t do anything kooky...keep it pale on the walls. OP: Thanks for all your replies! I’ll let you know how I get on eventually! User 2: It’s fantastic as is though! With the right furnishings, it is such a classic space. OP: It’s a really cool house hasn’t been decorated in a long time it’s like stepping back in time. I’ll take some before and after pics to show everyone when I’m done! User 3: I'm not sure if this is in your budget but this room would look gorgeous with wall paneling. OP: Ooo that’s a good idea, any examples of what you’d put on and colour ? User 3: Since it's Victorian I'd say keep a kind of classical look; remove the wallpaper and keep the walls a cool or pastel tone. Some simple white rectangular paneling, like [here]([URL] would probably look nice. Honestly, you could probably keep the wallpaper too, I think paneling breaks up patterns very nicely. OP: Thanks for the inspiration! Think the purchase will be dragged out for a while due to U.K. lockdown but we’ll see will update you when u can! User 4: I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:  - [/r/designmyroom] [I posted a little while ago and got some helpful comments! I got the keys now and am trying to do updates on IG I’m doing it as I’m going along so would love if anyone wanted to comment ideas and such as I go along!( continued in comments) please remove if not allowed]([URL]  &nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* OP: Forgot to add minimal budget!( my first time ever buying a property!) the door is behind where the picture was taken opposite the fireplace wall User 5: So you are looking to renovate and sell straight away? Or are you going to live in it for a while? If just for resale, I'd say to paint in a neitral colour and re-carpet/ laminate floor. OP: My idea was too rip up carpets and sand, varnish etc the hardwood flooring, I was going to buy a Victorian fireplace spruce it up and install it they’re only about £20-£80.   I’m just unsure on the wall colours as I want to avoid cream as it reminds everyone of renter accom and I want it to feel homely as it will most likely be sold to a family  I was thinking maybe a grey feature wall and like a sort of white on the rest maybe?\n",

OP: i think some people commented to ask where the boots are but i cant find the comments! these were from urban outfitters, but i got them on poshmark. i dont believe urban outfitters sells them anymore : ( User 1: Black suit with cropped pant legs with a black button up, top 2 buttons undone(if that feels comfy, bright hankie in breast pocket… maybe magenta-ish?? The shoes will pop and have they’re own moment. User 2: I just wanted to say I love the boots! Great find I’m sure they’ll look fantastic however you style them! OP: thank you!! : ) User 3: Light skinny jeans tucked in, fitted white T-shirt, black leather jacket User 4: Black dress pants and white or dark blue button up with some buttons undone maybe? Pair with gold or silver jewelry, depending what color the stars in the shoes are (Can’t really tell) OP: they’re black with gold stars! : ) User 4: Gold jewelry it is then :) User 5: I’m thinking a Janelle Monae inspired look - those androgynous  looks User 6: White button up shirt, rolled cuffs to elbows  Pinstripe slacks OP: pinstripe slacks! that’s a gorgeous suggestion, thank you : ) User 7: RW&Co in Canada has suiting pants that are tapered and a little cropped (if you're over 5'3\", they're a normal length on me). I have a pair in a merlot/burgundy colour, and I feel like they would be fantastic with these boots. A suggestion above says a white shirt, and I think that would look nice too. Gorgeous boots! OP: i looked on the website and their pants are gorgeous! i saw a pair labelled as mid-rise straight ankle pants, are these the pair you mentioned or are they different? User 7: Those are nice pants, but ones I meant are their suiting Signature pants. I think the ones I have are the Signature high-density ankle slim pants, they usually have seasonal colours. I have a 35\" waist and 45\" hips with a tummy and the size 14 fits nicely. I usually prefer a high rise but these fit like a mid rise and still look really nice, so they're really versatile pants. Good luck! User 8: Cropped boot cuff jeans, a white dress shirt open low and a black velvet vest that fits close to the body. User 9: I'd go with flared jeans and a buttoned shirt (if it's cold wearing the shirt over a turtleneck).   These boots are \"just\" black boots with a little bit of interesting texture, no need to be nervous about styling them. They would look good with almost anything! Have fun 💜 User 10: A mustard yellow long sleeved turtleneck, with dark navy blue high-waisted slim pants and a thin white leather belt. Together with a chunky white necklace of some kind. User 11: Black skinny jeans or leggings, a white or otherwise clear top. Dangly earrings and jewelry same color as the stars (I can’t tell if they’re silver or gold). Giving me Howl from howls moving castle vibes! Love it OP: the stars are gold! : ) i don’t have a lot of gold jewelry but i definitely need to change that haha, thank you for the suggestion! i totally agree that they have howl vibes ❤️ User 12: I'm thinking high waisted pants dark or pattern pants and over sized white shirt? Accessories could be necklace, some rings, maybe a hat, any that you think would fit the outfit idk. Those boots are sending me! Gorgeous! Also im just throwing suggestions, I'm no fashion lady :) OP: wide leg raw hem cropped jeans ! With a denim button up ! And a skinny silk scarf tied in a bow under the collar User 13: They would go with so much .. anything form a skrit or dress to jeans or leather pants . Dark bottom , light top with those.    Ps.

User 3: I love Alexander McQueen. It’s definitely a statement piece. User 4: I’m a huge fan of the style. I know the style of some on here is to be matchy matchy and I respect that, but don’t let it sway you away from a bag that you like. I agree with you, black goes with everything. I wish we saw more less traditional bags like this on here! User 5: I love McQueen and feel like this is a good representation of the brand. OP: Thanks! User 6: Same. Super cute User 7: It doesn't want the homeless to sleep on it. Sorry 🤣 it has an edgy, punk rock aesthetic that would be perfect with the right outfit but it just reminds me of hostile architecture. User 8: I think it’s very lovely. User 9: That’s beautiful and badass! I love it! User 10: I’ve been eyeing this myself as it’s one of my favorite brands. Go for it! User 11: It's lovely but  I'd put an eye out and rip all of my clothes.   LOL User 12: Love it! User 13: Do it sis! User 14: It’s wicked, edgy and punk rock! Love it 🖤 User 15: Love McQueen, got the sequined version of this one to have as a glam/evening bag and I love it! User 16: Love it. It’ll go with any outfit. Go for it! User 17: While not my style, I like that it’s a edgy and fun. User 18: I feel the studs and skull together are a bit much and giving an expected look. They have the bag in quilted blue and yellow with the skull and a bunch of other that contrast more with it and are more exciting for me personally. If you want to stay with black they also have one with rings attached that’s even more edgy. Also a designer handbag should be an “omg I love” purchase as it’s not a practical purchase but one to have fun with User 19: I've been looking at this one too! I love it even though it's very different from my usual style. If you get it please update us on the quality :) I don't have much experience with designer bags and need something like this in terms of size and style. I was curious about the quality of McQueen bags. User 20: Do u have a lot of outfits to wear it with or is it a collectors piece? OP: I have a few in mind but I can’t imagine it would be very hard to find outfits to match as the bag is black User 20: It has an edgy look to it. I'd say go for it if you'd wear it a lot. OP: Thanks! x User 21: I personally don’t care for the skulls but if you love that sort of gothic steam punk vibe then I’d say go for it. User 22: I’d choose other options for sure because it’s too edgy for my style, but If it isn’t for you, go for it! User 23: How much is it? OP: Around $1,770 (Australian dollars)\n",

User 1: not related, but these shoes lowkey remind me of sonic the hedgehog :) User 2: They remind me of Britain’s flag haha User 3: I would style these with jeans, or \"paper-bag pants\".  The slender silhouette will juxtapose a more loose-fitting pant and if the cut is at the ankle or above, will make your ankles look really delicate.  Bow off. User 4: Black jeans and an oversized large white shirt or even a sweatshirt. OP: Thanks, would black skinny jeans work and bow on or off? User 5: Ooh, I'm thinking maybe bell bottom jeans and a white blouse? Also, bow on. User 4: Bow on. The black jeans will compliment the colours and make sure they pop\n",

User 1: Plants User 2: The answer is always plants OP: That’s a great idea! Bamboo does well in indirect light so I think I’ll get some bamboo. I’m buying a bonsai tree soon (I just haven’t found the right one for me yet) so maybe it will sit up there too! User 3: Pothos plants, too! I love my pothos and they managed to survive through my last apartment which had direct light for about 1 hour a day, for 2 years. Just from your photo, I can tell you had more light than I did in that place. User 4: Bonsai do best outside iirc. Go for a Christmas cactus or another indoor low light plant instead. User 5: Depends on the species. If it's a tropical species it'll probably do well inside. If it's a decideous plant which grows in a more seasonal place there might be issues. User 6: Orchids do well inside User 7: Where do one go to find plants User 8: Your local nursery User 9: I've only bought babies there User 10: The plant nursery is way cheaper. User 11: Facebook marketplace too User 12: Came here to say this! Plant , plants, and more plants. User 13: Can you move it away from the window?  I don't like the look of blocking the window with decorations. OP: Yes, We decided we are going to switch my bed with my bookshelf so my bed will be in front of my window. Just not sure what types of decorations should go on it. Thank you! User 14: It's difficult to recommend decorations without seeing the placement of the shelf in the overall look. You will need to experiment until it balances out. For example, try the bottom shelf with large coffee table books lying flat and stacked in the centre or off centre.  On the next shelf up, perhaps a grouping of three different sized vases or combination of tall vase and stouter round glass ornament or bowl, off centre. Perhaps nearer the top lower candles, smaller book stacks and a small plant / cactus. Play around until it is visually pleasing. Don't jam up the bookshelf with stuff. OP: Thank you! I hate a bookshelf that is too full. I bought this from someone who had a serious movie collection and the shelf had just completely lost its beauty.. lol OP: Ignore everything else pictured, I don’t have my room *exactly* put together yet. I want to see what types of things should go on a bookshelf. I have a bunch of books and am buying geode bookends for them. I’m interested in the 70s, retro, etc... User 15: Cool shelf! Some options:  A) You have a statue, vase, plant,  matryoshka doll, [Barrel Man souvenir]([URL] Dundee Award, etc. that is awkward or unhappy in its current placement, or is languishing in a box of keepsakes somewhere. Something that you have always intended would have a place in your forever home.  B) A bar.  C) There is something on your wishlist that you didn't have a place for before. Get it.  If you don't have any such thing, I suggest you just wait until one falls into your lap, or you see something you just have to have. Or maybe ask a parent or older relative if they have some fun keepsakes you could display? Things have a way of accumulating, so I would avoid buying something you don't love just to fill the space. OP: So funny you mention a barrel man! While I was cleaning I found him and thought hmmm.... what a silly thing to put on my bookshelf. Lol! User 15: I have a couple on my bookshelf as well! OP: Some air plants in a glass jar or vase. Framed photo. Candles. Small statue/figurine. I’m not one for “live,love laugh” type quotes on a piece of painted wood but whatever floats your fancy. User 16: One of those ivys in a pot that cascades down, some succulents, books,  interesting looking glass vases or glass art since it’s in front of the window (goodwill is usually full of these for cheap) OP: I’m actually growing elephant bushes right now! They’re succulents and they grow like crazy and can cascade down. Once they’re in full form I think I’ll put one on top! User 17: Actual hamsters. User 18: a nice hour glass always gets me going User 19: 👏🏼 User 20: It's so cool! Look around your house, what items do you already have? I wouldn't go out and buy a bunch of department store decorative stuff to put on it, but I would start with what you already have.  It will take some moving things around to get a feel for what looks nice. Do you have books? Some of similar shape or color? Can you arrange them stacked on top of one another? Maybe 5 or 6 tall depending on how thick they are. If that doesn't look right, maybe you can get some cool book ends and arrange similar looking books together in groups. I wouldn't do too many in one grouping. What else do you have around? Jars or baskets? Cool plants, rocks or artifacts? Put them on the shelf and see what you think. I'd start there. OP: Take out shelves and stand and use for excercise wheel for your cat. If you don't have cat get one. User 21: One of my friends has a great shelf like this! Hers is from World Market. She has a a few clusters of books, picture frames with photos of friends/family, some plants (a trailing one would be nice), and maybe even a lamp? This is such a beautiful shelf! OP: The one from world market is my dream shelf! but it’s $400.. so I found this one on Offerup for $180.. and guess what? It’s the one from World Market! Lol I got soooo lucky, and it’s huge!  I dug up this oil lamp from our garage today (for decoration- not functional) and I think I’m going to set it up there. I’ll post a picture when It’s decorated! User 22: Bonsai! User 23: And a sword User 24: a record player would be nice to have and a tiny modern/zen-looking lamp as well. cacti and other plants would look great! User 25: A hamster plush User 26: Hi!  I almost bought that same planter/shelf because I love the design but held off because I was worried about the cat turning it into a giant hamster wheel.  Does it seem stable to you? OP: Yes, it’s very stable and quite hefty! User 26: Awesome.  Thanks! User 27: I think a large hamster would go really nicely here.  Or perhaps a chinchilla? depending on whats available locally User 28: It needs a hamster User 29: You seem to have a lot of plastic storage bins and other types of storage around the room. In addition to some plants and books, you might want to put some decorative baskets or containers to hold some of the items in the bins and then discard the bins. User 30: I thought this would make a neat bar.   You could find some inspiration in r/barbattlestations   But I suppose you’d have to be into that sort of thing, but it’s a cool bookshelf. User 31: PLANTS User 32: I would do a combination of books, esp coffee table books if you have them, interesting tchotchkes (aka knickknacks), a plant or two, a picture or two. Like others said, play around until it makes you happy. OP: Whatever you have that’s a round... User 33: Plants User 34: Ideas: yes plants, cactus/succulents are always good- cascading plant at top would look nice though, record player, vintage clock, books, candles, interesting vases, quirky stuff.... User 35: Marshall and plants. User 36: I love what someone else said - a bar, maybe with some live herbs for fancy cocktails and cocktail books. But if it’s the bedroom, maybe not a bar lol User 37: plants, little statues, books, decorative bowls\n",

User 1: I like the jacket, but depending on your body type, the dress might look a bit off. You might need some waist emphasis OP: Yes thats for pear shape User 2: Yeah this will look way off for pear shapes. We have wider hips and narrower top halves. Waist emphasis is crucial for us! OP: You can wear belt and define your waist but still you didn't balance upper and lower proportion of the body the shoulder still narrowband hips is maybe wider   you just cut it in half Thats my opinion User 2: Not sure what you mean by this. User 3: The jacket is perfect. I would look at shortening the dress to over the knee because the boot will make your legs look shorter. OP: Yes thats true! User 2: Tips from a petite pear:   * Add more waist empasis to the dress. Look for something shorter (at/above the knee) and with a belt or cinched waist and a gentle a-line or fit-and-flare silhouette. This maxi length sheath/shift dress will make petite pears look swallowed up and blob-like.  * The ankle boot is going to cut and shorten the leg on most petites. Either opt for a black boot and pair it with black tights, or go with a shoe with a lower vamp.  * The jacket, too -- cropped is cute, but the straight crop will probably just make the entire body look as wide as a petite pear's hip, and give the illusion of being overall wider and shorter than you already are. Instead, look for a cropped jacket that nips in at the waist and gently hits the high hip, adding more waist emphasis to the look.  * The bag is perfect. Love it. User 4: Looks awesome! I like the association of the different shades of green and a note of blue with the bag :) User 5: Looks great! User 6: I love that jacket and the shade of green. User 7: Where is the jacket from?

            "User 147 - dtykmy Original Post: Any suggestions on making this room look better? I feel like something is off. I am not sure where to start. Image: this living room has a lot of furniture and a dog bed in the middle of it. User 1: The layout of the furniture is super awkward looking.  I assume there is a TV over the white cabinet with the stained top?  If that is the case, I would put the longer sofa under the window, the shorter sofa under the three windows and put the white chair to the left of the window (facing the three windows, not lined up with the sofa).  That would be a much more natural arrangement of furniture.  Beyond that, you definitely need art and need to stop adding little knickknacks to the space.  But fix the layout issues before you do anything else. OP: Thank you! I was thinking the same thing about the awkward layout of the furniture. An actual home designer did this. It’s been a very frustrating and expensive experience. I’ll try that layout! User 2: That's ridiculous User 3: The above arrangement makes more sense. That chair could also go out from the couch under the windows and kinda angled for the tv. Just gives a couple options. Other than wonky layout? Everything is too low! So art, mirrors, tall bookcase to pull the eye upwards.  Edit: after looking at it I think the issue is the designer makes it look more staged. You need functional and live there. User 4: Depending on the rest of the layout of this space,  I might consider moving the tv to a lower piece of furniture underneath the windows and moving all the furniture as the person above me suggested but rotated 90 degrees so one couch is under the big window and the other is facing the three small windows and then you could put a narrow console table behind that couch. Also, I saw in another comment you were thinking about replacing the flooring and I would suggest just continuing with the hard wood through the living room and get a nice big patterned rug. User 5: I do think the suggested layout makes more sense but I don't feel like there's any room for artwork with all these windows. I think that would just make it look cluttered. Also, I don't think your knickknacks look bad or cluttered at all (though I guess if you got a bunch more they might).  I think a longer coffee table would help as well as a bigger tree. OP: By the way, the couches are the same size. Would you still recommend the layout you suggested? User 1: yes User 6: More dogs! User 7: Weird angles. Move the couches to line up with the walls User 8: I think the particular choice of styling for the furniture and accents (curtains, lamp shades, carpet) all combine to make it look like the lounge of a retirement home.  The carpet, sofas, and curtains all really bother me - especially all together like this. OP: I laughed so hard at your comment. I agree. But help me out. I can’t exactly burn my house down and start over lol. My forte is...not design. So I hired someone with great reviews, and i think she made it worse. User 8: No worries.  I think the room itself is good, those 3 windows are actually pretty cool.  I would consider replacing the sofas with comfy leather in a darker shade (black or darkest brown).  Choose an accent colour scheme (2 or 3 colours that look good together, probably a light, mid, and dark shade) - whatever is your favourite and don't be afraid to choose something bold, it's for accent not dominant. Choose curtains and throw cushions in that colour scheme and in a style of your choice, and that should give you a good foundation to build on.  From there you can add accent pieces like lamps or other decorations to suit your taste.  I think the very mundane colour scheme of the current room is really what kills it, and also just realizing that the couches are all different colours - that is certainly adding to the strange, not-really-home feeling of the room.  The grey carpet will be fine if it's matched with a cozier couch in a contrasting colour and less lacy curtains.  The \"modern rustic\" coffee table and side-runner should also match the cozy dark leather couch suggestion just fine. (I'm pretty sure it's a side-runner anyway, we only see a small edge of it on the far right of the photo.) OP: Thanks for your input!  These are new and pricey couches, I would prefer not to have to replace those and just work the room around them.  I think the beige chair needs to go and I totally need different window treatments on the main window, what would you recommend?  I thought I could do some kind of accent color velvet chair(s) as well.  I am hanging some art below the 3 windows, they need to be adjusted but here is what they look like: ([URL]) User 9: Those pictures look great!  I agree with rotating the couches to line up with the walls, and perhaps something else to bring your eyes up, such as a hanging plant in the corner where that tree is, a taller tree, or even several hanging plants across the front window. User 8: Hmm, those couches and carpet combo are really not doing it for me personally.  Those are nice art hangings though.  I think the couches could be balanced by much darker flooring, but area rugs on carpet is kinda weird.  I would sort out the carpet / couch situation before choosing window treatments, but I think a darker colour would work well to add some coziness.  I feel like I keep suggesting \"darker colour\" because everything is a pretty neutral shade and I think offsetting that with a darker shade would give a sense of coziness. User 8: Maybe a simple starting point is to rotate the furniture so it lines up with walls, and put a dark area rug in the central area under coffee table? OP: Ok, new carpet is definitely doable and we wanted better quality carpet anyway.  Love that idea.  Do you think a charcoal-like color would do it for new carpet color? User 8: Yep, I think charcoal would fit perfectly.  Less worry about stains that way too.  Building on that, darker or mid-shade curtains would probably do nicely - but I would wait until after the carpet is replaced before making final decision on curtains. User 10: Are you trying to sell? If you are, then the neutral colors and lack of decor are good so that people can insert themselves mentally into your home.  &#x200B;  If you aren't trying to sell, ask for your money back. All the neutrals blend into each other, and not in a good way. Get some stuff at different heights. Lamps, art, pretty literally anything that will give an impression that a family lives there and not some kind of museum caregiver. User 11: Yeah! Go to a local art market and find some cool pieces you like - invest a bit in your space. Maybe there are some bright throw blankets you can toss over the back of a couch, or maybe a slightly less retirement home-like lampshade you can stick on your lamps. Target has a lot of inexpensive decor if you're not sure about finding some really weird stuff. And definitely add some more greenery! User 12: I think a big, colorful area rug would warm it up some. It feels a little cold to me. User 8: I agree, that carpet is bothering me so much.  Especially combined with those sofas and curtains. User 12: To the left of the cat, is that an opening to another room/door outside? I had a room just like that. I helped to put the back of the sofa facing that with a sofa table behind User 13: “To the left of the cat”  made me chuckle. Thanks for the giggle!! OP: Yes to the left of cat, there is a small dining area and sliding glass doors going out to the porch. What do you mean by sofa table behind? User 11: Not enough dogs. :>  For real though:   Put one sofa under the big window and one along the three windows, then move that white chair over to where your two doggos are and put it on an angle facing kitty-corner to the corner with the tree. Your lamp table can go in the corner where the tree is, the tree can move to where the cat is, the dogs can move to where that brown side table is, and that table can find another home entirely. Your furniture is all fine - it looks like nice quality stuff! The placement is just awkward. :) User 14: You have some good advice in here already about how to rearrange the seating to make more sense, and I see that you are considering changing the curtains out for something darker. Other than that, a floor lamp would be a nice addition. Can't quite figure out where to put it until the furniture is all moved around, but having at least 3 different places for light helps bring a room together.   Dark blue curtains might look nice if you pull the blue from the throw pillows and add some pieces in the room that match it, for example the table lamps or a throw blanket on the white chair. User 15: I actually like the couches. I think new carpet (or at least a rug) and new curtains would make a massive difference. I’d paint the walls a lighter and brighter shade too if possible. I think you need some texture (texture carpet, textured throw) to add some visual interest too. User 16: I didn’t read any of the comments but it would be super nice if you had some color. Maybe a nice yellow or a deep red? User 17: If i may ask what brand the couch in the middle is, or maybe both couches are? Looks like the kind i want OP: Both couches are through the manufacturer \"Craftmaster.\"  I would just go to their website and browse their fabrics, I chose a high performance fabric because I have pets.  The couches have a herringbone design on them too. User 18: Move the plant from behind sofa, and move it against wall where the cat is.😃pretty furniture! My favorite style. Cottage meets pottery barn.👍✅😇 User 19: Rotate 45° User 20: I'd move the chairs and couches                CHAIRS              H         C            C             O          U                U        O                   C      C                      H User 21: I think a bigger coffee table could help or potentially a rug (yes, even over carpet). And going along with the layout change someone else mentioned (can't remember their name, but you did reply to that comment already). It just feels like something is missing in the center. But on the bright side, I also think your place really only needs minor changes :) Best of luck User 21: Oh, and a taller plant in the back would probably help too! A hanging planter might be cool if you want to experiment with that. Either way, adding more greenery, whether fake or real, would be a big help. User 22: I'm going to try my hand at this just because I was looking for this subreddit for a house we just bought.    The arrangement of furniture is odd I've drawn a suggestion.  And you can view that in the link below.   With that suggestion a sofa table behind the love seat would be great and then a larger coffee table.   The big miss in here is a lack of color. It's beige/brown overload and it all needs broken up a bit.     Curtains like what I have with the suggested layout would look great! [URL] User 23: I just feel like the walls are bare and could use some art or photos. User 24: Large dark jade green pillows and a large plant. User 25: Angle the sofas to the wall. I like the lack of clutter. Just a little art work for wall. Less is better in my opinion.  No junkie nick backs. User 26: There's a lot of negative space.  You need more dogs. User 27: It's the angle that the two 3 seater couches make. It doesn't quiet look right. Just try moving them around or taking one of them out of the space. User 28: I'd add a few more pets to the mix. That would make it look REAL cozy. User 29: I'd move the couch to create a separation between the wood floor room and the carpet room. Then I'd put the other couch at a straight angle as well, against the window. I think I like the chair where it is.  The coffee table feels too small for the room and for the furniture. A way I might remedy that without buying a new table is to push it closer to one couch so it doesn't look like all the furniture is sharing the table. User 30: Oh my dog, that room looks like heaven to me.  It's beautiful and full of dogs!  Can I come over?  (and I don't think the furniture is awkward at all. User 31: Found the designer of the room! User 30: Not a boomer.\n",
            "User 148 - bne4xw Original Post: Any recommendations to give my living room a modern style? Image: two sofas are arranged in a room with tiled floors. User 1: Center couch to window User 2: Please User 3: Dark blue lines would be good. A tv would be nice and some photos OP: What exactly do you mean by blue lines? User 1: Side tables.  Coffee table.  Rug. OP: Working on all three! Thanks! OP: Just a little bit of information on what I am going for. I’m trying to go for modern looking living room. Mostly a gray scale look but with touches of color here and there. Maybe with some plants or a coffee table center piece.  I’m thinking about a geometric bookshelf in the corner near the window. One nice one I was on [Wayfair]( [URL] I think it has a nice modern look to it. What's nice about this one is the depth of this bookcase is perfect and would not cover any of the windows.  For a rug I was thinking a nice flat woven style. Preferably in a light grey or [white]( [URL] to compliment the gray scale of the couches and tiles. I’m actually having a hard time finding a light grey one. I must just go with a white one.  For the coffee table, I was thinking along the lines of a contemporary [three-legged]( [URL] table. Or even a glass one would work! I am really loving the style for this [one]( [URL] Unfortunately, it might be too big for when I get a TV stand.   What do you guys think? Any recommendations? User 4: I'm a fan of giant white picture frames. Maybe two on the dark green wall and one on the wall across? Also, maybe move the couch against the green wall to the other for easy light switch access? User 5: Get rid of the 90’s couches.. redo the floor if you can, get rid of the tiles and replace it with carpet. Repaint the walls. Honestly the whole room looks like a dentist waiting lobby. If you can’t do any of these things because you’re renting, a book case, a big rug and some paintings will go along way with a nice glass coffee table. OP: Haha I swear the couches look better in person. I think with the proper decor, it will look less 90s. User 6: Joke comment.   1 single camera  1 lighting apparatus 1 desk. User 7: Modern floor lamp, plant and a couple of pillow with a pop of color User 2: Plants !\n",
            "User 149 - evaydd Original Post: How can I make my living room feel more comfortable? Image: a living room with a couch, tv, coffee table, and a large window. User 1: curtains! OP: What color would you suggest? User 1: great question! I'm not some incredible designer, but I think it needs to be a lighter color because there's a lot of dark items on the floor (couch, TV table, wood chair etc.) I'd suggest a cream color, maybe with a cute pattern on it? Something with orange or red/burgundy accents.  I'd like to add that I like the room! It's a bit dark but it looks really comfortable.  edit: if you decide to go for curtains, I'd love to see what it ends up looking like! User 2: Maybe cream color with a dark red pattern woven through them? Or to with a dark teal. User 3: You have quite a large space!! I would center your rug to the window on the left of the space and move your couch forward. Put a console table behind your couch with lamps or framed pictures! OP: I’ll try moving those pieces around thank you! User 3: Your space is so lovely! I love all of the natural light. OP: Thank you! User 4: I think some light curtains might help make the space feel a little more cozy.  Maybe it's the angle of the photo but the rug feels a little small for the space.    Painting the walls a warm neutral might also be a nice touch. OP: It’s a rental so I can’t paint the walls but I’ll definitely get some curtains, thank you! User 5: Put the curtain rod high not right at the window top.  I also think a much larger rug that you can get the front of the sofa on and the front part of those two chairs will make it all seem together . Well ... second look.. maybe that rug edge would be too close to the Tv stand and the (?) fireplace edge like that .  Maybe just a larger rug but not that large User 6: Nothing but curtains, in a warm shade maybe. It's already a very nice room, congrats User 7: Curtains are a great suggestion! As is a larger rug- I would incorporate some color into the rug too. I would also suggest framing the art. Love this space- those green chairs are awesome! User 8: How about more ambience lighting?... OP: I have been looking at floor lamps actually thanks for the suggestion! User 9: Go for a larger rug, move the coffee table to be a side table and get a larger coffee table or ottoman. User 10: curtains and a MUCH larger area rug with color and  pattern. the chair will always be statement pieces  and the rest of the room is pretty nuetral so any color for rug and curtains will work!  I agree a floor lamp will help too. OP: The current rug is 5x6.5, what size rug do you think would work? 6x9? User 11: I would get a much bigger rug--I think it would make it seem warmer. I echo the recommendation of curtains, too, for the same reason.  Also, I like the coffee table, but the lines of that design don't say \"comfort\" to me. Does that make sense? OP: It does make sense! Thank you! User 2: Maybe an end table for the couch and of course many more plants, especially if you can hang them or get something for height. User 12: You’ve got an odd mix of things here, but it can work. You need to frame those posters. They’re cool and modern, but those two chairs (which I love) are pretty old-fashioned.  I think this can work if you keep in mind that you are mixing two styles.  I think somebody mention teal for the curtains, and I can see a solid teal curtain working well there. You’ll need to have teal somewhere else, two or three places, but they don’t have to be big, maybe a thread in the rug and one teal/turquoise vase.  Nice room. Unique and cozy. User 12: I wouldn’t go for many more plants. The trend now is a lot of plants, but that’s just a trend, and people go overboard. Less is more in my book.\n",
            "User 150 - hae1z6 Original Post: Does the line rug look okay????? Opinions please. Image: a bedroom with a black accent wall has a chair and a bed in it. User 1: I would prefer the rectangle rug to be straight not at an angle with the bed but that's just me! User 2: I don’t mind that at all. It’s out of the box but not in your face. OP: I tried but unfortunately its a 5x7 and it was too small the next size up was too big so I tried to use it somehow. Thanks for the suggestion though! User 1: The rug looks plenty big enough to either be straight across the end of your bed or have one rug on either side of the bed. Or place under bed stretching to under chair with white rug on top User 3: [URL] I’m confused. Is it because you wanted to layer the rugs? Seems like graphic 1 applies. OP: So your picture was the original plan but the rug was too small. I was trying to see if I could make it work before having to return. User 4: Yeah, angle is off-putting User 5: I did the same thing in my nursery. Personally,I like it. User 6: Love it! The pattern and the angle.   Do you have a pad underneath to prevent it from curling up/rolling/etc?  Now you just need some really amazing art above the bed. OP: Hi! I do. Its a velcro rug pad and its a pain to install so I figured I’d tried it without it in case I had to return it 😅 User 7: Ruggable? Fair warning, they never fit the same after the first wash... The corners curl and they shrink a bit, so it’s insanely difficult to put it back on (even with two of us!). They even replaced our first one and same issue, although the 2nd one didn’t shrink as much. But we will keep being Ruggable customers because our dogs. OP: Same here! I have a Golden and a Black Pit Mix. But thanks for the warning! Maybe I’ll wash with cold water and air dry in that case and hope it doesn’t shrink. User 7: We got ours when Ruggable first got big, like only had a few patterns, so it’s possible the issue is fixed! We did follow the washing instructions exactly. We just position it in a way that the side where the pad will stick out is what’s under the couch. One plus is the dogs love rug switch day. They like to roll all over the fresh rug while we are trying to even it out 😂 User 8: I’m a newer ruggable customer. And nope, the issue still persists. I just hide the short side under my couch too. But my dogs love the rugs so it’s good enough for me. User 7: Ah that’s a bummer! Their customer service blamed it on me and said that only an inch should hang off. I was like I get that but there’s not even that much... we’ll I’ll still be buying them for my dogs too! Just wish they would make the rugs a tiny bit bigger. User 6: Don't return it. I love it! User 9: Because your colour palette is fairly muted you can use a lot of different textures! I think it looks great User 10: Love it User 11: Yes I love this! Also where did you get those throw blankets?? OP: The sweater blanket  [URL]   The throw on the bed   [URL] User 11: Thank you! OP: The one on the chair is super thick and cozy 💕 User 11: It looks so cozy!! I’m buying that one for sure! User 12: I love it too! User 13: What paint color is that on the wall? Love it! User 14: seconded would love to know User 15: Love the rug, and I really like that you’ve placed it at an angle. If it were me though I would pull it towards the door a little more so the faux fur doesn’t overlap it. OP: I’ll definitely try that! Thank you User 16: ID on the bed frame? User 17: Where is that bedframe from? Love it! OP: Thank you! All Modern.    [URL] User 18: Love it. Just makes it stand out a little more. Sometimes I get far too obsessed with symmetry and this is a nice touch. Out of place but not out of place. OP: Thank you 🙏🏻☺️ User 19: I am honestly curious, how is using a bed facing the window for you? No light on your in the morning ? OP: Hi! I purchased this window covering.   [URL]  The light option doesn’t let anyone see in during day time and that dark option blocks all light. Highly recommend. User 20: I love the color scheme of this room! Gives me so many inspirations User 21: LOVE this room! You did such a good job! I think the rug is perfect User 22: We have the same rug!! User 23: What are the paint colors? They look great! User 24: You need some accent colors and maybe some wall art (with matching colors) OP: Hi! I’m planning to add some wall art and introduce more greenery and gold accents. User 25: I love the rug! But I don’t like the faux fur because it distracts from the beautiful rug. OP: Thank you! I’ll play around with the placement. ☺️ User 26: Ocddddddd OP: Sorry lol User 27: The edge of the rug jutting out of the bed seems slightly off but overall it seems to blend in overall with the look. User 28: I like it a lot. I think you could show a bit more of the rug on bottom by pulling it towards the bare floor more. User 29: Do YOU like the rug? If so then keep it that way. The only opinion that should matter is yours :) (But I do like the rug) User 30: Love the rug like that 10/10 innovative\n",
